    "# Java Basics: \"Hello, World!\", Comments and Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "This note covers the very basics of getting started with Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Types of Comments in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Java uses comments to explain your code, make it more readable, and temporarily disable code from being executed. There are three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-line Comments: Start with //. Anything after // on the same line is ignored by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// This is a single-line comment.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-line Comments (Javadoc): Start with /* and end with */. These can span multiple lines. Often used for documenting classes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/*\n",
    " * This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    " * It can extend across several lines.\n",
    " * This is frequently used for Javadoc.\n",
    " */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Javadoc Comments: A specific type of multi-line comment primarily used for generating documentation. These comments have a special format, and tools like javadoc can automatically create HTML documentation from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/**\n",
    " * This is a Javadoc comment.\n",
    " * It describes the purpose of a method.\n",
    " * @param name   The name for the person.\n",
    " * @return  A greeting string.\n",
    " */\n",
    "public String greet(String name) {\n",
    "    // ... code ...\n",
    "    return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. \"Hello, World!\" Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the classic \"Hello, World!\" program in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class HelloWorld { // Must match the filename (HelloWorld.java)\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "public class HelloWorld: Declares a public class named HelloWorld. The class name must match the file name (HelloWorld.java).\n",
    "public static void main(String[] args): This is the main method, the entry point for your Java program.\n",
    "System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");: Prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n",
    "System.out: The standard output stream.\n",
    "println(): A method that prints a line of text and then moves the cursor to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. File Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Names: Class names must be in PascalCase (e.g., HelloWorld, MyClass).\n",
    "File Names: The file name must match the class name exactly, including capitalization. So, if your class is named MyClass, the file must be named MyClass.java. This is a critical rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Compilation\n",
    "Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a command prompt (cmd.exe).\n",
    "Navigate to the directory containing your .java file. Use the cd command (e.g., cd C:\\MyJavaProject).\n",
    "Compile: javac HelloWorld.java (This creates a .class file â€“ HelloWorld.class).\n",
    "Run: java HelloWorld\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix/Linux/macOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal.\n",
    "Navigate to the directory containing your .java file (e.g., cd /home/user/MyJavaProject).\n",
    "Compile: javac HelloWorld.java\n",
    "Run: java HelloWorld\n",
    "Important Note: The javac command compiles the .java file into .class bytecode. The java command then executes this bytecode."
