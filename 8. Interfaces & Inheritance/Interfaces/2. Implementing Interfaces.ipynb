    "# Java Interface Implementation: The Relatable Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "An interface in Java defines a contract that classes must follow. It specifies what methods a class must implement without providing the actual implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass implements InterfaceName {\n",
    "    // class implementation\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Rules\n",
    "- Use the `implements` keyword followed by the interface name\n",
    "- Can implement multiple interfaces (comma-separated list)\n",
    "- If extending a class, `implements` comes after `extends`\n",
    "- Must provide concrete implementations for all interface methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Relatable Interface Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface Definition\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface Relatable {\n",
    "    // Method to compare object sizes\n",
    "    // Returns: 1 (larger), 0 (equal), -1 (smaller)\n",
    "    public int isLargerThan(Relatable other);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Allows objects to be compared based on their \"size\" or magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Implementation: RectanglePlus Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class RectanglePlus implements Relatable {\n",
    "    public int width = 0;\n",
    "    public int height = 0;\n",
    "    public Point origin;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructors and other methods...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Required implementation of Relatable interface\n",
    "    public int isLargerThan(Relatable other) {\n",
    "        RectanglePlus otherRect = (RectanglePlus)other;\n",
    "        if (this.getArea() < otherRect.getArea())\n",
    "            return -1;\n",
    "        else if (this.getArea() > otherRect.getArea())\n",
    "            return 1;\n",
    "        else\n",
    "            return 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we create two rectangles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "RectanglePlus rect1 = new RectanglePlus(5, 4);  // Area = 20\n",
    "RectanglePlus rect2 = new RectanglePlus(3, 6);  // Area = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "int comparison = rect1.isLargerThan(rect2);\n",
    "// Returns 1 because rect1 (area=20) > rect2 (area=18)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Type Casting\n",
    "```java\n",
    "RectanglePlus otherRect = (RectanglePlus)other;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The parameter `other` is of type `Relatable`\n",
    "- We cast it to `RectanglePlus` to access specific methods like `getArea()`\n",
    "- Casting tells the compiler the actual object type\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Return Values Convention\n",
    "- **1**: Current object is larger\n",
    "- **0**: Objects are equal in size\n",
    "- **-1**: Current object is smaller\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interface Benefits\n",
    "- **Consistency**: All implementing classes have the same comparison method\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Any class can implement `Relatable` if size comparison makes sense\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Can compare objects without knowing their exact class type\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Interfaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardization**: Ensures all implementing classes have the same method signatures\n",
    "2. **Code Reusability**: Write code that works with any `Relatable` object\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new classes that can be compared\n",
    "4. **Maintainability**: Changes to interface affect all implementing classes consistently\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparing objects by size, weight, priority, or value\n",
    "- Sorting collections of objects\n",
    "- Creating uniform behavior across different classes\n",
    "- Building flexible, extensible code architectures"
