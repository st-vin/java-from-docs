    "# Using an Interface as a Type\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define an interface in Java, you're creating a new **reference data type** that can be used anywhere other data types are used. This allows you to create flexible, reusable code that works with any class implementing the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concept: Interface as a Reference Type\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it means:** You can declare variables using an interface name as the type, and assign any object that implements that interface to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Pattern:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "InterfaceName variableName = objectThatImplementsInterface;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example: The `Relatable` Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding the Largest Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a method that finds the larger of two objects, working with any objects from classes that implement `Relatable`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public Object findLargest(Object object1, Object object2) {\n",
    "   Relatable obj1 = (Relatable)object1;  // Cast to Relatable type\n",
    "   Relatable obj2 = (Relatable)object2;  // Cast to Relatable type\n",
    "   \n",
    "   if ((obj1).isLargerThan(obj2) > 0)\n",
    "      return object1;\n",
    "   else \n",
    "      return object2;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why casting works:** By casting `object1` to `Relatable`, we can call the `isLargerThan` method that's defined in the `Relatable` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Comparison Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The same principle applies to other comparison operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the Smallest Object\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public Object findSmallest(Object object1, Object object2) {\n",
    "   Relatable obj1 = (Relatable)object1;\n",
    "   Relatable obj2 = (Relatable)object2;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   if ((obj1).isLargerThan(obj2) < 0)\n",
    "      return object1;\n",
    "   else \n",
    "      return object2;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking Equality\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public boolean isEqual(Object object1, Object object2) {\n",
    "   Relatable obj1 = (Relatable)object1;\n",
    "   Relatable obj2 = (Relatable)object2;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   if ((obj1).isLargerThan(obj2) == 0)\n",
    "      return true;\n",
    "   else \n",
    "      return false;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using Interfaces as Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Flexibility Across Classes**\n",
    "- These methods work with **any** objects from classes that implement `Relatable`\n",
    "- The objects' class inheritance doesn't matter - only that they implement the interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Simulating Multiple Inheritance**\n",
    "When a class implements an interface:\n",
    "- The object can be treated as **both** its original class type **and** the interface type\n",
    "- This provides some advantages of multiple inheritance (having behavior from multiple sources)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Code Reusability**\n",
    "- Write once, use with many different classes\n",
    "- No need to create separate comparison methods for each class type\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Example in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have these classes that all implement `Relatable`:\n",
    "- `Student` (compares by grade)\n",
    "- `Employee` (compares by salary)  \n",
    "- `Product` (compares by price)\n",
    "\n",
    "The same `findLargest()` method can compare:\n",
    "- Two students (returns student with higher grade)\n",
    "- Two employees (returns employee with higher salary)\n",
    "- Two products (returns product with higher price)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Using interfaces as types creates **polymorphic** behavior - the same method can work with different types of objects, as long as they all implement the required interface. This is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that promotes code flexibility and reusability."
