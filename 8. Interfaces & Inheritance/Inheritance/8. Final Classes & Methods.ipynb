    "# Writing Final Classes and Methods in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `final` keyword in Java allows you to prevent methods and classes from being modified through inheritance. This is crucial for maintaining code integrity and ensuring consistent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Final Methods?\n",
    "A **final method** is a method that cannot be overridden by any subclass. You declare it by adding the `final` keyword to the method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "```java\n",
    "final ReturnType methodName(parameters) {\n",
    "    // method body\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Final Methods\n",
    "Use final methods when:\n",
    "- The implementation should **never change**\n",
    "- The method is **critical to maintaining the object's state**\n",
    "- The method is **called from a constructor**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Chess Algorithm\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class ChessAlgorithm {\n",
    "    enum ChessPlayer { WHITE, BLACK }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    final ChessPlayer getFirstPlayer() {\n",
    "        return ChessPlayer.WHITE;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this final?** The rule that white always moves first is fundamental to chess. Allowing subclasses to change this would break the game's logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special Case: Final Methods in Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rule\n",
    "**Methods called from constructors should generally be declared final.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "If a constructor calls a non-final method:\n",
    "1. A subclass could override that method\n",
    "2. The overridden version runs during parent class construction\n",
    "3. This can cause unexpected behavior because the subclass isn't fully initialized yet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Problematic code\n",
    "class Parent {\n",
    "    Parent() {\n",
    "        initialize();  // Non-final method called in constructor\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    void initialize() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Parent initialized\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    private int value = 10;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    void initialize() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Value is: \" + value);  // Might print 0, not 10!\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Final Classes?\n",
    "A **final class** cannot be subclassed at all. No class can extend it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "```java\n",
    "final class ClassName {\n",
    "    // class body\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Final Classes\n",
    "Final classes are particularly useful for:\n",
    "- **Immutable classes** (classes whose state cannot change after creation)\n",
    "- **Security-sensitive classes**\n",
    "- Classes where inheritance would break the design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The String Class\n",
    "The built-in `String` class is declared final:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public final class String {\n",
    "    // String implementation\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** If String could be subclassed, you could create a malicious subclass that changes its value, breaking the immutability guarantee that the entire Java ecosystem depends on.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Class Final Methods\n",
    "The `Object` class (the parent of all Java classes) declares several of its methods as final to ensure consistent behavior across all objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable Class Example\n",
    "```java\n",
    "final class BankAccount {\n",
    "    private final String accountNumber;\n",
    "    private final double initialBalance;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    BankAccount(String accountNumber, double initialBalance) {\n",
    "        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;\n",
    "        this.initialBalance = initialBalance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    final String getAccountNumber() {\n",
    "        return accountNumber;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    final double getInitialBalance() {\n",
    "        return initialBalance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures no one can create a subclass that modifies the account's core properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Purpose | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|---------|----------|\n",
    "| **Final Method** | Prevents method override | Critical business logic, constructor-called methods |\n",
    "| **Final Class** | Prevents subclassing | Immutable classes, security-sensitive code |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Use `final` to protect critical code from being changed through inheritance, ensuring your classes behave consistently and predictably."
