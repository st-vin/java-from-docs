    "# Field Hiding in Java - Complete Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Field hiding** occurs when a subclass declares a field with the same name as a field in its superclass. This concept is important to understand in object-oriented programming, particularly in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Field Hiding?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a subclass defines a field with the **same name** as a field in the superclass:\n",
    "- The subclass field **hides** the superclass field\n",
    "- This happens **regardless of the data types** of the fields\n",
    "- The superclass field still exists but becomes inaccessible by its simple name within the subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Type Independence\n",
    "Field hiding occurs even when the fields have different types:\n",
    "- Superclass field: `int value`\n",
    "- Subclass field: `String value`\n",
    "- Result: The superclass field is hidden\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Access Restrictions\n",
    "Within the subclass:\n",
    "- ❌ Cannot access the superclass field using its simple name\n",
    "- ✅ Must use the `super` keyword to access the hidden field\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Parent {\n",
    "    String message = \"Hello from Parent\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    String message = \"Hello from Child\";  // Hides Parent's message field\n",
    "    \n",
    "    void printMessages() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(message);        // Prints: Hello from Child\n",
    "        System.out.println(super.message);  // Prints: Hello from Parent\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `Child` class has a field named `message`\n",
    "- This hides the `message` field from the `Parent` class\n",
    "- Inside `Child`, using `message` alone refers to the child's field\n",
    "- Using `super.message` accesses the parent's hidden field\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example with Different Types\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Account {\n",
    "    int balance = 1000;  // Integer type\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class SavingsAccount extends Account {\n",
    "    double balance = 2500.50;  // Double type - still hides parent's balance\n",
    "    \n",
    "    void showBalances() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Savings balance: \" + balance);        // 2500.50\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Account balance: \" + super.balance);  // 1000\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Point:\n",
    "Even though `balance` is an `int` in the parent and a `double` in the child, field hiding still occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Hidden Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `super` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super` keyword allows you to access the superclass's hidden field:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Vehicle {\n",
    "    String type = \"Generic Vehicle\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car extends Vehicle {\n",
    "    String type = \"Car\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    void displayTypes() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Subclass type: \" + type);        // Car\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Superclass type: \" + super.type); // Generic Vehicle\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Field Hiding is Discouraged\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Code Readability Issues**\n",
    "- Makes code confusing and harder to understand\n",
    "- Developers must remember which field they're accessing\n",
    "- Increases cognitive load when reading code\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Maintenance Challenges**\n",
    "- Changes to field names become error-prone\n",
    "- Debugging becomes more difficult\n",
    "- Can lead to unexpected behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Violates Clear Design Principles**\n",
    "- Creates ambiguity in the code structure\n",
    "- Contradicts the principle of least surprise\n",
    "- Makes inheritance relationships unclear\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Use **different field names** in subclasses\n",
    "- Use **method overriding** instead of field hiding when polymorphic behavior is needed\n",
    "- Access parent class fields through getter methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Hide fields with the same name in subclasses\n",
    "- Rely on field hiding for polymorphic behavior\n",
    "- Use field hiding as a design pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Approach: Different Field Names\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Employee {\n",
    "    String name = \"John Doe\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Manager extends Employee {\n",
    "    String departmentName = \"Sales\";  // Different name - no hiding\n",
    "    \n",
    "    void printInfo() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Employee name: \" + name);\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Department: \" + departmentName);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is **clearer** and **easier to maintain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Definition** | Subclass field with same name as superclass field |\n",
    "| **Type Requirement** | Occurs regardless of field types |\n",
    "| **Access Method** | Use `super` keyword to access hidden field |\n",
    "| **Recommendation** | **Avoid** - makes code difficult to read |\n",
    "| **Alternative** | Use different field names or getter methods |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "While Java allows field hiding, it is **strongly discouraged** as a programming practice. Clear, readable code with distinct field names is always preferable to relying on the `super` keyword to differentiate between hidden fields."
