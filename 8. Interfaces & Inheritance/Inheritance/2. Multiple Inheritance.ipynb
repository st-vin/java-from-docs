    "# Multiple Inheritance in Java: State, Implementation, and Type\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Java handles inheritance differently than some other programming languages by distinguishing between three types of multiple inheritance: **state**, **implementation**, and **type**. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for working effectively with classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Multiple Inheritance of State\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The ability to inherit fields (instance variables) from multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Java Prohibits This\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Restriction:** Java does NOT allow a class to extend more than one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:** To avoid field conflicts and ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Hypothetical example (NOT allowed in Java)\n",
    "class Parent1 {\n",
    "    int value = 10;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent2 {\n",
    "    int value = 20;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// If this were allowed...\n",
    "class Child extends Parent1, Parent2 {\n",
    "    // Which 'value' field does Child inherit?\n",
    "    // Parent1's value (10) or Parent2's value (20)?\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Conflict:**\n",
    "- If `Child` could extend both `Parent1` and `Parent2`, it would inherit two different `value` fields\n",
    "- When a method or constructor tries to initialize or access `value`, which one should it use?\n",
    "- This creates ambiguity that's difficult to resolve\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Interfaces Don't Have This Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Interfaces cannot contain fields (instance variables), only constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since interfaces don't have state (fields), you can implement multiple interfaces without worrying about field conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Multiple Inheritance of Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The ability to inherit method definitions (actual code) from multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems that arise:**\n",
    "- **Name conflicts**: Multiple superclasses may have methods with the same name\n",
    "- **Ambiguity**: The compiler cannot determine which method implementation to use\n",
    "- **Accidental conflicts**: Adding a new method to a superclass might unintentionally create naming conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Hypothetical scenario\n",
    "class ClassA {\n",
    "    void display() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Display from ClassA\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class ClassB {\n",
    "    void display() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Display from ClassB\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// If multiple inheritance were allowed...\n",
    "class ClassC extends ClassA, ClassB {\n",
    "    // When calling display(), which one executes?\n",
    "    // ClassA's or ClassB's?\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Java's Approach: Default Methods in Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Java introduces a **limited form** of multiple inheritance of implementation through **default methods** in interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "interface Interface1 {\n",
    "    default void greet() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface1\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "interface Interface2 {\n",
    "    default void greet() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Hello from Interface2\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {\n",
    "    // Compiler requires you to resolve the conflict\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void greet() {\n",
    "        Interface1.super.greet(); // Explicitly choose which to use\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Java Handles This:**\n",
    "The Java compiler provides rules to determine which default method to use, or requires the programmer to explicitly resolve the conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Multiple Inheritance of Type\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The ability of a class to implement more than one interface, allowing an object to have multiple types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java DOES allow this**, and it's one of the most powerful features of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has multiple types:\n",
    "1. The type of its own class\n",
    "2. The types of all interfaces the class implements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "interface Flyable {\n",
    "    void fly();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "interface Swimmable {\n",
    "    void swim();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {\n",
    "    public void fly() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Duck is flying\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void swim() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Duck is swimming\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "Duck myDuck = new Duck();\n",
    "Flyable flyingThing = myDuck;  // Duck IS a Flyable\n",
    "Swimmable swimmingThing = myDuck;  // Duck IS also a Swimmable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Benefit:**\n",
    "- A `Duck` object can be referenced as a `Duck`, a `Flyable`, or a `Swimmable`\n",
    "- If a variable is declared as an interface type, it can reference any object from any class that implements that interface\n",
    "- This provides tremendous flexibility in polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void makeItFly(Flyable thing) {\n",
    "    thing.fly();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// You can pass any object that implements Flyable\n",
    "makeItFly(new Duck());\n",
    "makeItFly(new Airplane());\n",
    "makeItFly(new Bird());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | What It Inherits | Java Support | Reason |\n",
    "|------|------------------|--------------|--------|\n",
    "| **Multiple Inheritance of State** | Fields from multiple classes | ❌ **NOT allowed** | Prevents field conflicts and ambiguity |\n",
    "| **Multiple Inheritance of Implementation** | Method definitions from multiple sources | ⚠️ **Limited** (via default methods) | Compiler rules help resolve conflicts |\n",
    "| **Multiple Inheritance of Type** | Type identity from multiple interfaces | ✅ **Fully supported** | Safe and powerful; enables polymorphism |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes vs. Interfaces**: Classes have fields and can be instantiated; interfaces cannot\n",
    "2. **Single class inheritance**: A class can only extend one other class to avoid state conflicts\n",
    "3. **Multiple interface implementation**: A class can implement multiple interfaces safely\n",
    "4. **Default methods**: Introduce controlled multiple inheritance of implementation\n",
    "5. **Polymorphism**: Multiple inheritance of type enables flexible and reusable code design"
