    "## What is an Abstract Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract class** is a special type of class that:\n",
    "- Is declared with the `abstract` keyword\n",
    "- Cannot be instantiated (you can't create objects directly from it)\n",
    "- Can be subclassed (other classes can extend it)\n",
    "- May or may not contain abstract methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public abstract class GraphicObject {\n",
    "   // This class cannot be instantiated\n",
    "   abstract void draw();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Abstract Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract method** is a method declared without implementation:\n",
    "- Has no method body (no curly braces)\n",
    "- Ends with a semicolon\n",
    "- Must be implemented by subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rule\n",
    "If a class contains even one abstract method, the class itself **must** be declared abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract Classes vs Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarities\n",
    "- Neither can be instantiated\n",
    "- Both can contain a mix of implemented and unimplemented methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Abstract Classes | Interfaces |\n",
    "|---------|-----------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Fields** | Can have non-static, non-final fields | All fields are public, static, and final |\n",
    "| **Methods** | Can have public, protected, and private methods | All methods are public |\n",
    "| **Inheritance** | Can extend only ONE class | Can implement MULTIPLE interfaces |\n",
    "| **State** | Can maintain object state | Cannot maintain object state |\n",

    "## When to Use Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Use abstract classes when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sharing code among related classes**\n",
    "   - Example: Multiple shape classes sharing common properties\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Common methods/fields needed**\n",
    "   - Classes need protected or private access modifiers\n",
    "   - Example: All shapes have position and color\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-static or non-final fields required**\n",
    "   - Need to modify object state\n",
    "   - Example: Tracking current position of a graphic object\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: AbstractMap in JDK\n",
    "Classes like `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `ConcurrentHashMap` extend `AbstractMap` to share methods like `get`, `put`, `isEmpty`, `containsKey`, and `containsValue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Use interfaces when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unrelated classes need same behavior**\n",
    "   - Example: `Comparable` and `Cloneable` implemented by many different classes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specifying behavior without implementation details**\n",
    "   - You care about \"what\" but not \"who\" implements it\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple inheritance needed**\n",
    "   - A class can implement multiple interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: HashMap in JDK\n",
    "`HashMap` implements `Serializable`, `Cloneable`, and `Map<K, V>` interfaces while also extending `AbstractMap` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example: Drawing Application\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "A drawing app needs circles, rectangles, lines, and curves. They all:\n",
    "- Share common states: position, color\n",
    "- Share common behaviors: moveTo, rotate\n",
    "- Have different implementations: draw, resize\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Abstract superclass\n",
    "abstract class GraphicObject {\n",
    "    int x, y;  // Common fields\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Concrete method (shared implementation)\n",
    "    void moveTo(int newX, int newY) {\n",
    "        this.x = newX;\n",
    "        this.y = newY;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Abstract methods (must be implemented by subclasses)\n",
    "    abstract void draw();\n",
    "    abstract void resize();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Concrete subclass\n",
    "class Circle extends GraphicObject {\n",
    "    void draw() {\n",
    "        // Circle-specific drawing code\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    void resize() {\n",
    "        // Circle-specific resizing code\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Another concrete subclass\n",
    "class Rectangle extends GraphicObject {\n",
    "    void draw() {\n",
    "        // Rectangle-specific drawing code\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    void resize() {\n",
    "        // Rectangle-specific resizing code\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Class Implementing an Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class doesn't need to implement all interface methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "abstract class X implements Y {\n",
    "    // Implements some but not all methods of Y\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class XX extends X {\n",
    "    // Implements the remaining methods from Y\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Class `X` must be abstract because it's incomplete, but class `XX` can be concrete if it implements everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static Members in Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes can have static fields and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "abstract class AbstractClass {\n",
    "    static int counter = 0;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    static void staticMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Static method called\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "AbstractClass.staticMethod();  // Valid!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these static members with the class name, just like any other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract classes** provide a template for related classes to share code\n",
    "2. **Abstract methods** define behavior that subclasses must implement\n",
    "3. Use abstract classes for **inheritance hierarchy** with shared implementation\n",
    "4. Use interfaces for **defining contracts** across unrelated classes\n",
    "5. Modern Java often uses **both** together (like `HashMap` does)"
