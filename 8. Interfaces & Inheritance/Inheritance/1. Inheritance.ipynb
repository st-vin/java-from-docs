    "# Java Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows classes to derive from other classes, automatically inheriting their fields and methods. This promotes code reuse and establishes hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subclass (Derived Class)\n",
    "A class that inherits from another class. Also called:\n",
    "- Derived class\n",
    "- Extended class\n",
    "- Child class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Superclass (Base Class)\n",
    "The class from which a subclass inherits. Also called:\n",
    "- Base class\n",
    "- Parent class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Inheritance\n",
    "- Every class in Java has **one and only one direct superclass**\n",
    "- Exception: `Object` class has no superclass\n",
    "- If no superclass is explicitly specified, the class implicitly extends `Object`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance Chain\n",
    "Classes can form inheritance chains:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Object → Class A → Class B → Class C\n",
    "```\n",
    "Class C is descended from all classes in the chain back to `Object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Object Class Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Object` class sits at the top of Java's class hierarchy:\n",
    "- Defined in the `java.lang` package\n",
    "- All classes in Java ultimately descend from `Object`\n",
    "- Provides common behavior implemented by all classes\n",
    "- Classes near the top are more general; classes near the bottom are more specialized\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example: Bicycle Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parent Class: Bicycle\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Bicycle {\n",
    "    // Fields\n",
    "    public int cadence;\n",
    "    public int gear;\n",
    "    public int speed;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructor\n",
    "    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {\n",
    "        gear = startGear;\n",
    "        cadence = startCadence;\n",
    "        speed = startSpeed;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Methods\n",
    "    public void setCadence(int newValue) {\n",
    "        cadence = newValue;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void setGear(int newValue) {\n",
    "        gear = newValue;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {\n",
    "        speed -= decrement;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void speedUp(int increment) {\n",
    "        speed += increment;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subclass: MountainBike\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {\n",
    "    // New field added by subclass\n",
    "    public int seatHeight;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructor\n",
    "    public MountainBike(int startHeight,\n",
    "                        int startCadence,\n",
    "                        int startSpeed,\n",
    "                        int startGear) {\n",
    "        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);\n",
    "        seatHeight = startHeight;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // New method added by subclass\n",
    "    public void setHeight(int newValue) {\n",
    "        seatHeight = newValue;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What MountainBike Inherits\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MountainBike` class automatically inherits:\n",
    "- **Fields**: `cadence`, `gear`, `speed`\n",
    "- **Methods**: `setCadence()`, `setGear()`, `applyBrake()`, `speedUp()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus it adds:\n",
    "- **New field**: `seatHeight`\n",
    "- **New method**: `setHeight()`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: MountainBike has 4 fields and 5 methods without rewriting existing code!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Subclasses Inherit\n",
    "\n",
    "A subclass inherits all **members** from its parent:\n",
    "- Fields\n",
    "- Methods\n",
    "- Nested classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "- **Constructors are NOT inherited** (they're not members)\n",
    "- However, the superclass constructor can be invoked using `super()`\n",
    "- Access depends on visibility modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance Based on Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "| Member Type | Inherited? |\n",
    "|------------|-----------|\n",
    "| `public` members | Yes, always |\n",
    "| `protected` members | Yes, always |\n",
    "| Package-private (no modifier) | Only if subclass is in same package |\n",
    "| `private` members | No, but accessible through public/protected methods |\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Can Do in a Subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use Inherited Fields\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// In MountainBike, you can directly use:\n",
    "this.speed = 10;  // Inherited from Bicycle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Hide Fields (Not Recommended)\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {\n",
    "    public int speed;  // Hides Bicycle's speed field\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Add New Fields\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int seatHeight;  // New field not in Bicycle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Inherited Methods\n",
    "```java\n",
    "myBike.speedUp(5);  // Method inherited from Bicycle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Override Instance Methods\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Override\n",
    "public void speedUp(int increment) {\n",
    "    speed += increment * 2;  // Different implementation\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Hide Static Methods\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void someStaticMethod() {\n",
    "    // Hides static method from superclass\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Add New Methods\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void setHeight(int newValue) {\n",
    "    seatHeight = newValue;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Invoke Superclass Constructor\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public MountainBike(int startHeight, int startCadence, \n",
    "                    int startSpeed, int startGear) {\n",
    "    super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);  // Calls Bicycle constructor\n",
    "    seatHeight = startHeight;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private Members in Superclass\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Access: No\n",
    "Subclasses **cannot directly access** private members of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indirect Access: Yes\n",
    "If the superclass provides public or protected methods (getters/setters), the subclass can use those:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Bicycle {\n",
    "    private int speed;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public int getSpeed() {\n",
    "        return speed;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {\n",
    "    public void displaySpeed() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(getSpeed());  // OK: using public method\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Case: Nested Classes\n",
    "A public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all private members of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Relationships\n",
    "When you create an object:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "MountainBike myBike = new MountainBike();\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `myBike` is of type `MountainBike`\n",
    "- `myBike` is also a `Bicycle` (parent)\n",
    "- `myBike` is also an `Object` (ultimate parent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"IS-A\" Relationship\n",
    "- A `MountainBike` **IS-A** `Bicycle` ✓\n",
    "- A `MountainBike` **IS-AN** `Object` ✓\n",
    "- A `Bicycle` **MAY BE** a `MountainBike` (not necessarily) ✗\n",
    "- An `Object` **MAY BE** a `MountainBike` (not necessarily) ✗\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Casting (Upcasting)\n",
    "Moving from specific to general type happens automatically:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Object obj = new MountainBike();  // Automatically cast to Object\n",
    "Bicycle bike = new MountainBike();  // Automatically cast to Bicycle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit Casting (Downcasting)\n",
    "Moving from general to specific type requires explicit cast:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Object obj = new MountainBike();\n",
    "MountainBike myBike = (MountainBike) obj;  // Explicit cast required\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without casting:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "MountainBike myBike = obj;  // Compile-time ERROR!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Runtime Checking\n",
    "Explicit casts are checked at runtime:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Object obj = new Bicycle();\n",
    "MountainBike myBike = (MountainBike) obj;  // Runtime exception!\n",
    "```\n",
    "If `obj` is not actually a `MountainBike`, a runtime exception is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safe Casting with instanceof\n",
    "Use the `instanceof` operator to check type before casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (obj instanceof MountainBike) {\n",
    "    MountainBike myBike = (MountainBike) obj;\n",
    "    // Safe to use myBike here\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"obj is not a MountainBike\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents runtime exceptions by verifying the type first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Reuse\n",
    "Write code once in the parent class, use it in multiple subclasses without duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easier Maintenance\n",
    "Bug fixes and improvements in the parent class automatically benefit all subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Organization\n",
    "Creates a natural hierarchy that models real-world relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "Objects can be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexible code design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful feature that:\n",
    "- Allows classes to extend other classes using the `extends` keyword\n",
    "- Enables code reuse by inheriting fields and methods\n",
    "- Creates hierarchical relationships with `Object` at the top\n",
    "- Supports both implicit (upcasting) and explicit (downcasting) casting\n",
    "- Requires careful handling of private members and constructors\n",
    "- Should be used with `instanceof` checks for safe downcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding inheritance, you can write more efficient, maintainable, and organized Java code."
