    "# Polymorphism in Java: A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Polymorphism?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that comes from biology, where it describes organisms that can exist in different forms or stages. In programming, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class, while still maintaining their unique behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses can:\n",
    "- Define their own unique behaviors\n",
    "- Share functionality from their parent class\n",
    "- Override parent methods to provide specialized implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Polymorphism Through Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Base Class: Bicycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The example starts with a simple `Bicycle` class that has a method called `printDescription()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void printDescription(){\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"\\nBike is \" + \"in gear \" + this.gear\n",
    "        + \" with a cadence of \" + this.cadence +\n",
    "        + \" and travelling at a speed of \" + this.speed + \". \");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method displays basic information about any bicycle: gear, cadence, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Specialized Subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. MountainBike Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MountainBike` class extends `Bicycle` and adds a special feature: **suspension**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Has a `suspension` field (String type)\n",
    "- Can be \"Front\" (front shock absorber only) or \"Dual\" (front and back shock absorbers)\n",
    "- **Overrides** the `printDescription()` method to include suspension information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {\n",
    "    private String suspension;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public MountainBike(int startCadence, int startSpeed, \n",
    "                        int startGear, String suspensionType){\n",
    "        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);\n",
    "        this.setSuspension(suspensionType);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public String getSuspension(){\n",
    "        return this.suspension;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void setSuspension(String suspensionType) {\n",
    "        this.suspension = suspensionType;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void printDescription() {\n",
    "        super.printDescription();  // Calls parent method first\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"The MountainBike has a\" +\n",
    "            getSuspension() + \" suspension.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Notice how `printDescription()` calls `super.printDescription()` first to display basic bike information, then adds suspension details.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. RoadBike Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RoadBike` class extends `Bicycle` and adds a different feature: **tire width**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Has a `tireWidth` field (measured in millimeters)\n",
    "- Racing bikes have skinny tires, so this tracks the tire width\n",
    "- Also **overrides** the `printDescription()` method to include tire information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class RoadBike extends Bicycle{\n",
    "    private int tireWidth;  // In millimeters (mm)\n",
    "\n",
    "    public RoadBike(int startCadence, int startSpeed,\n",
    "                    int startGear, int newTireWidth){\n",
    "        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);\n",
    "        this.setTireWidth(newTireWidth);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public int getTireWidth(){\n",
    "        return this.tireWidth;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void setTireWidth(int newTireWidth){\n",
    "        this.tireWidth = newTireWidth;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void printDescription(){\n",
    "        super.printDescription();  // Calls parent method first\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"The RoadBike has \" + getTireWidth() +\n",
    "            \" MM tires.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Test Program\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where polymorphism really shines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class TestBikes {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args){\n",
    "        Bicycle bike01, bike02, bike03;\n",
    "\n",
    "        bike01 = new Bicycle(20, 10, 1);\n",
    "        bike02 = new MountainBike(20, 10, 5, \"Dual\");\n",
    "        bike03 = new RoadBike(40, 20, 8, 23);\n",
    "\n",
    "        bike01.printDescription();\n",
    "        bike02.printDescription();\n",
    "        bike03.printDescription();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's Happening:**\n",
    "- All three variables are declared as type `Bicycle`\n",
    "- Each variable is assigned a different object (Bicycle, MountainBike, or RoadBike)\n",
    "- When `printDescription()` is called, each object executes its own version of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Bike is in gear 1 with a cadence of 20 and travelling at a speed of 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bike is in gear 5 with a cadence of 20 and travelling at a speed of 10. \n",
    "The MountainBike has a Dual suspension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike is in gear 8 with a cadence of 40 and travelling at a speed of 20. \n",
    "The RoadBike has 23 MM tires.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "- `bike01` displays only basic bicycle information\n",
    "- `bike02` displays basic information PLUS suspension details\n",
    "- `bike03` displays basic information PLUS tire width\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Method Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** determines which method to call based on:\n",
    "- The **actual object type** (what the object really is)\n",
    "- NOT the **variable type** (how the variable is declared)\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is called **virtual method invocation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Bicycle bike = new MountainBike(20, 10, 5, \"Dual\");\n",
    "bike.printDescription();  // Calls MountainBike's version!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though `bike` is declared as `Bicycle`, the JVM calls `MountainBike`'s `printDescription()` method because that's the actual object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Classes in the Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bicycle** - Parent class with basic functionality\n",
    "2. **MountainBike** - Child class with suspension feature\n",
    "3. **RoadBike** - Child class with tire width feature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Subclasses inherit parent functionality\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Different objects can be treated uniformly\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: New bike types can be added easily\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Common code stays in the parent class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Overriding Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subclasses can override parent methods\n",
    "- Use `super.methodName()` to call the parent's version\n",
    "- Each subclass can add its own unique behavior\n",
    "- The JVM automatically calls the correct version at runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of polymorphism like a universal remote control:\n",
    "- The remote (parent class) has basic buttons that work for all devices\n",
    "- Your TV, DVD player, and stereo (subclasses) each respond differently to the same \"power\" button\n",
    "- You use the same remote interface, but each device behaves according to its own nature\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what polymorphism does in Java!"
