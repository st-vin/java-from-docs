    "## Instance Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Method Overriding?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that already exists in its superclass. The overriding method must have:\n",
    "- The same name\n",
    "- The same number and type of parameters (same signature)\n",
    "- The same return type (or a covariant return type)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Override Methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding allows a subclass to inherit behavior from a superclass that is \"close enough\" and then modify it as needed for specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariant Return Types\n",
    "\n",
    "An overriding method can return a **subtype** of the return type declared in the superclass method. This is called a covariant return type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Animal {\n",
    "    public Animal reproduce() {\n",
    "        return new Animal();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public Dog reproduce() {  // Dog is a subtype of Animal\n",
    "        return new Dog();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The @Override Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@Override` annotation instructs the compiler to verify that you're actually overriding a superclass method. If the method doesn't exist in the superclass, the compiler generates an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Vehicle {\n",
    "    public void start() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Vehicle starting\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car extends Vehicle {\n",
    "    @Override  // Recommended practice\n",
    "    public void start() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Car starting\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**The version of the overridden instance method that gets invoked is always the one in the subclass**, regardless of the reference type used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static Method Hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Method Hiding?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a subclass defines a **static method** with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, the subclass method **hides** (not overrides) the superclass method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Difference from Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "**The version of the hidden static method that gets invoked depends on whether it is invoked from the superclass or the subclass** (determined at compile-time, not runtime).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Animal {\n",
    "    public static void testClassMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"The static method in Animal\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void testInstanceMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"The instance method in Animal\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Cat extends Animal {\n",
    "    public static void testClassMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"The static method in Cat\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void testInstanceMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"The instance method in Cat\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Cat myCat = new Cat();\n",
    "        Animal myAnimal = myCat;  // Cat object with Animal reference\n",
    "        Animal.testClassMethod();      // Calls Animal's static method\n",
    "        myAnimal.testInstanceMethod(); // Calls Cat's instance method\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "The static method in Animal\n",
    "The instance method in Cat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static methods** are resolved at **compile-time** based on the reference type\n",
    "- **Instance methods** are resolved at **runtime** based on the actual object type (polymorphism)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default and Abstract Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Default methods and abstract methods in interfaces are inherited like instance methods. However, conflicts can arise when multiple interfaces provide methods with the same signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance Resolution Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Java follows two key principles to resolve naming conflicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Principle 1: Instance Methods Are Preferred Over Interface Default Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Horse {\n",
    "    public String identifyMyself() {\n",
    "        return \"I am a horse.\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public interface Flyer {\n",
    "    default public String identifyMyself() {\n",
    "        return \"I am able to fly.\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public interface Mythical {\n",
    "    default public String identifyMyself() {\n",
    "        return \"I am a mythical creature.\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Pegasus extends Horse implements Flyer, Mythical {\n",
    "    public static void main(String... args) {\n",
    "        Pegasus myApp = new Pegasus();\n",
    "        System.out.println(myApp.identifyMyself());\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `I am a horse.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The inherited instance method from `Horse` takes precedence over the default methods in `Flyer` and `Mythical`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Principle 2: Already Overridden Methods Are Ignored**\n",
    "\n",
    "When supertypes share a common ancestor, methods already overridden by other candidates are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface Animal {\n",
    "    default public String identifyMyself() {\n",
    "        return \"I am an animal.\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public interface EggLayer extends Animal {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    default public String identifyMyself() {\n",
    "        return \"I am able to lay eggs.\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public interface FireBreather extends Animal { }\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Dragon implements EggLayer, FireBreather {\n",
    "    public static void main(String... args) {\n",
    "        Dragon myApp = new Dragon();\n",
    "        System.out.println(myApp.identifyMyself());\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `I am able to lay eggs.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`EggLayer` overrides `Animal.identifyMyself()`, so `Dragon` inherits from `EggLayer`. `FireBreather` doesn't override it, so it's ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "If two or more independently defined default methods conflict, you **must explicitly override** the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface OperateCar {\n",
    "    default public int startEngine(EncryptedKey key) {\n",
    "        // Implementation\n",
    "        return 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public interface FlyCar {\n",
    "    default public int startEngine(EncryptedKey key) {\n",
    "        // Implementation\n",
    "        return 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class FlyingCar implements OperateCar, FlyCar {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public int startEngine(EncryptedKey key) {\n",
    "        // You can call specific interface implementations\n",
    "        FlyCar.super.startEngine(key);\n",
    "        OperateCar.super.startEngine(key);\n",
    "        return 2;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax `InterfaceName.super.methodName()` allows you to invoke a specific interface's default implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Methods Override Abstract Interface Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Inherited instance methods from classes can override abstract interface methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface Mammal {\n",
    "    String identifyMyself();  // Abstract method\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Horse {\n",
    "    public String identifyMyself() {\n",
    "        return \"I am a horse.\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Mustang extends Horse implements Mammal {\n",
    "    public static void main(String... args) {\n",
    "        Mustang myApp = new Mustang();\n",
    "        System.out.println(myApp.identifyMyself());\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `I am a horse.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Horse` class's instance method satisfies the `Mammal` interface requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static methods in interfaces are never inherited.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access Modifiers Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overriding and Access Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "The access specifier for an overriding method can allow **more access, but not less**, than the overridden method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Valid Examples:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Parent {\n",
    "    protected void display() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Parent\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void display() {  // More accessible (protected → public) ✓\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Child\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Invalid Example:**\n",

    "        System.out.println(\"Child\");\n",
    "    }\n",

    "### Important Distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a subclass, you can **overload** methods inherited from the superclass by changing the signature (different parameters). These overloaded methods:\n",
    "- **Do NOT hide** the superclass methods\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance methods** are overridden and resolved at **runtime** (polymorphism)\n",
    "2. **Static methods** are hidden and resolved at **compile-time** (no polymorphism)\n",
    "3. **Interface default methods** follow specific inheritance rules with clear precedence\n",
    "4. **Access modifiers** can only become more permissive when overriding\n",
    "5. **Never mix static and instance** methods with the same signature\n",
    "6. Use **@Override** annotation to catch errors at compile-time\n",
    "7. **Overloading** creates new methods; it doesn't override or hide"
