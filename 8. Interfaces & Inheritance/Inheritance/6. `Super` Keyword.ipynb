    "# Understanding the `super` Keyword in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `super` keyword in Java allows a subclass to access members (methods and fields) of its superclass, particularly when they have been overridden or hidden. This is essential for maintaining the parent-child relationship between classes in inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Accessing Superclass Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Method Overriding?\n",
    "When a subclass defines a method with the same signature as one in its superclass, the subclass method **overrides** the superclass method. To access the original superclass method, you must use the `super` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superclass:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Superclass {\n",
    "    public void printMethod() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Printed in Superclass.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subclass:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Subclass extends Superclass {\n",
    "    // Overrides printMethod in Superclass\n",
    "    public void printMethod() {\n",
    "        super.printMethod();  // Calls the superclass version\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Printed in Subclass\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Subclass s = new Subclass();\n",
    "        s.printMethod();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Printed in Superclass.\n",
    "Printed in Subclass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Point\n",
    "- Without `super.printMethod()`, only the subclass version would execute\n",
    "- The `super` keyword provides a **qualified name** to specifically reference the superclass method\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Accessing Hidden Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "While **not recommended**, `super` can also reference superclass fields that have been hidden by subclass fields with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Field hiding is discouraged in Java programming. It's better to use different field names or proper encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Invoking Superclass Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rule\n",
    "When a subclass is instantiated, it must initialize both its own state and the state inherited from its superclass. This is done by invoking the superclass constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example: Bicycle Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MountainBike extends Bicycle {\n",
    "    private int seatHeight;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public MountainBike(int startHeight, \n",
    "                        int startCadence,\n",
    "                        int startSpeed,\n",
    "                        int startGear) {\n",
    "        // Must be the FIRST line in constructor\n",
    "        super(startCadence, startSpeed, startGear);\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Subclass-specific initialization\n",
    "        seatHeight = startHeight;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Options\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. No-argument constructor:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "super();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calls the superclass constructor with no parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Parameterized constructor:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "super(parameter list);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calls the superclass constructor with matching parameter types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Rule\n",
    "**The invocation of a superclass constructor MUST be the first line in the subclass constructor.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Important Automatic Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit Constructor Calls\n",
    "If you don't explicitly call a superclass constructor, the Java compiler **automatically inserts** `super()` to call the no-argument constructor of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    public Child() {\n",
    "        // Compiler automatically adds: super();\n",
    "        // Your code here\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Compilation Error\n",
    "If the superclass **does not have a no-argument constructor**, and you don't explicitly call a parameterized constructor, you'll get a **compile-time error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem scenario:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Parent {\n",
    "    // No no-argument constructor\n",
    "    public Parent(String name) {\n",
    "        // ...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    public Child() {\n",
    "        // ERROR! Compiler tries to call super(), but it doesn't exist\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    public Child() {\n",
    "        super(\"default name\");  // Explicitly call parameterized constructor\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Constructor Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Constructor Chaining?\n",
    "When a subclass constructor is called, it triggers a **chain reaction** of constructor calls up the inheritance hierarchy, all the way to the `Object` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Object (top of hierarchy)\n",
    "  ↑\n",
    "  | super() call\n",
    "  |\n",
    "GrandParent\n",
    "  ↑\n",
    "  | super() call\n",
    "  |\n",
    "Parent\n",
    "  ↑\n",
    "  | super() call\n",
    "  |\n",
    "Child (instantiated class)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class GrandParent {\n",
    "    GrandParent() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"GrandParent constructor\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent extends GrandParent {\n",
    "    Parent() {\n",
    "        super();  // Calls GrandParent constructor\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Parent constructor\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child extends Parent {\n",
    "    Child() {\n",
    "        super();  // Calls Parent constructor\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Child constructor\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Creating: new Child();\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// GrandParent constructor\n",
    "// Parent constructor\n",
    "// Child constructor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Understanding constructor chaining is crucial when working with **long inheritance hierarchies**, as each level must properly initialize before the next level can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Key Rule | Example |\n",
    "|--------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| **Method Access** | Use `super.methodName()` to call overridden methods | `super.printMethod();` |\n",
    "| **Constructor Syntax** | `super()` or `super(params)` | `super(startCadence, startSpeed);` |\n",
    "| **Constructor Position** | Must be **first line** in subclass constructor | Compile error otherwise |\n",
    "| **Automatic Insertion** | Java adds `super()` if you don't | May cause errors if no no-arg constructor exists |\n",
    "| **Constructor Chain** | Constructors execute from `Object` down to current class | Aware of this in deep hierarchies |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always be explicit** when calling superclass constructors with parameters\n",
    "2. **Ensure superclasses have no-argument constructors** or explicitly handle parameterized ones\n",
    "3. **Avoid hiding fields**—use `super` only for methods and constructors\n",
    "4. **Understand the initialization order** in your class hierarchies"
