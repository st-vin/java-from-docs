    "# Annotations Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Format of an Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, an annotation looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Entity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The at sign character (@) indicates to the compiler that what follows is an annotation. In the following example, the annotation's name is Override:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Override\n",
    "void mySuperMethod() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotation can include *elements*, which can be named or unnamed, and there are values for those elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Author(\n",
    "   name = \"Benjamin Franklin\",\n",
    "   date = \"3/27/2003\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "class MyClass { ... }\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "@SuppressWarnings(value = \"unchecked\")\n",
    "void myMethod() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is just one element named value, then the name can be omitted, as in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n",
    "void myMethod() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the annotation has no elements, then the parentheses can be omitted, as shown in the previous `@Override` example.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to use multiple annotations on the same declaration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Author(name = \"Jane Doe\")\n",
    "@EBook\n",
    "class MyClass { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the annotations have the same type, then this is called a repeating annotation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Author(name = \"Jane Doe\")\n",
    "@Author(name = \"John Smith\")\n",
    "class MyClass { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotation type can be one of the types that are defined in the java.lang or java.lang.annotation packages of the Java SE API. In the previous examples, Override and SuppressWarnings are predefined Java annotations. It is also possible to define your own annotation type. The Author and Ebook annotations in the previous example are custom annotation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where Annotations Can Be Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotations can be applied to declarations: declarations of classes, fields, methods, and other program elements. When used on a declaration, each annotation often appears, by convention, on its own line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of the Java SE 8 release, annotations can also be applied to the use of types. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Class instance creation expression:\n",
    "    new @Interned MyObject();\n",
    "Type cast:\n",
    "    myString = (@NonNull String) str;\n",
    "implements clause:\n",
    "    class UnmodifiableList<T> implements\n",
    "        @Readonly List<@Readonly T> { ... }\n",
    "Thrown exception declaration:\n",
    "    void monitorTemperature() throws\n",
    "        @Critical TemperatureException { ... }\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n"
