    "# **Equality, Relational, and Conditional Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Equality and Relational Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The equality and relational operators determine if one operand is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "==      equal to\n",
    "!=      not equal to\n",
    ">       greater than\n",
    ">=      greater than or equal to\n",
    "<       less than\n",
    "<=      less than or equal to\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program, ComparisonDemo, tests the comparison operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class ComparisonDemo {\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args){\n",
    "        int value1 = 1;\n",
    "        int value2 = 2;\n",
    "        if(value1 == value2)\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"value1 == value2\");\n",
    "        if(value1 != value2)\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"value1 != value2\");\n",
    "        if(value1 > value2)\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"value1 > value2\");\n",
    "        if(value1 < value2)\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"value1 < value2\");\n",
    "        if(value1 <= value2)\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"value1 <= value2\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "value1 != value2\n",
    "value1 <  value2\n",
    "value1 <= value2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Conditional Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The `&&` and `||` operators perform `Conditional-AND` and `Conditional-OR` operations on two boolean expressions. These operators exhibit \"short-circuiting\" behavior, which means that the second operand is evaluated only if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "&& Conditional-AND\n",
    "|| Conditional-OR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program, ConditionalDemo1, tests these operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class ConditionalDemo1 {\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args){\n",
    "        int value1 = 1;\n",
    "        int value2 = 2;\n",
    "        if((value1 == 1) && (value2 == 2))\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"value1 is 1 AND value2 is 2\");\n",
    "        if((value1 == 1) || (value2 == 1))\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"value1 is 1 OR value2 is 1\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another conditional operator is `?:`, which can be thought of as shorthand for an `if-then-else statement` (discussed in the Control Flow Statements section of this lesson). This operator is also known as the **ternary operator** because it uses three operands. In the following example, this operator should be read as: \"If someCondition is true, assign the value of value1 to result. Otherwise, assign the value of value2 to result.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program, ConditionalDemo2, tests the `?:` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class ConditionalDemo2 {\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args){\n",
    "        int value1 = 1;\n",
    "        int value2 = 2;\n",
    "        int result;\n",
    "        boolean someCondition = true;\n",
    "        result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;\n",
    "\n",
    "        System.out.println(result);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because someCondition is true, this program prints \"1\" to the screen. Use the `?:` operator instead of an if-then-else statement if it makes your code more readable; for example, when the expressions are compact and without side-effects (such as assignments).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Type Comparison Operator instanceof\n",
    "The `instanceof` operator compares an object to a specified type. You can use it to test if an object is an instance of a class, an instance of a subclass, or an instance of a class that implements a particular interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program, `InstanceofDemo`, defines a parent class (named Parent), a simple interface (named MyInterface), and a child class (named Child) that inherits from the parent and implements the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class InstanceofDemo {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parent obj1 = new Parent();\n",
    "        Parent obj2 = new Child();\n",
    "\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"obj1 instanceof Parent: \"\n",
    "            + (obj1 instanceof Parent));\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"obj1 instanceof Child: \"\n",
    "            + (obj1 instanceof Child));\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"obj1 instanceof MyInterface: \"\n",
    "            + (obj1 instanceof MyInterface));\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"obj2 instanceof Parent: \"\n",
    "            + (obj2 instanceof Parent));\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"obj2 instanceof Child: \"\n",
    "            + (obj2 instanceof Child));\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"obj2 instanceof MyInterface: \"\n",
    "            + (obj2 instanceof MyInterface));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent {}\n",
    "class Child extends Parent implements MyInterface {}\n",
    "interface MyInterface {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "obj1 instanceof Parent: true\n",
    "obj1 instanceof Child: false\n",
    "obj1 instanceof MyInterface: false\n",
    "obj2 instanceof Parent: true\n",
    "obj2 instanceof Child: true\n",
    "obj2 instanceof MyInterface: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the instanceof operator, keep in mind that null is not an instance of anything."
