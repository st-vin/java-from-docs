    " int speed = 0;\n",
    " int gear = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This operator can also be used on objects to assign object references, as discussed in Creating Objects.\n",

    "## The Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java programming language provides operators that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",

    "The increment/decrement operators can be applied before (prefix) or after (postfix) the operand. The code result++; and ++result; will both end in result being incremented by one. The only difference is that the prefix version (++result) evaluates to the incremented value, whereas the postfix version (result++) evaluates to the original value. If you are just performing a simple increment/decrement, it doesn't really matter which version you choose. But if you use this operator in part of a larger expression, the one that you choose may make a significant difference.\n",
