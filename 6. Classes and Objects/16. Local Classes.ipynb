    "# Local Classes in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Local classes are classes defined within a block (a group of statements enclosed in braces). They are typically found inside method bodies, but can also be defined in for loops, if clauses, or any other block structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaring Local Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a local class inside any block. Here's a practical example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class LocalClassExample {\n",
    "    static String regularExpression = \"[^0-9]\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public static void validatePhoneNumber(String phoneNumber1, String phoneNumber2) {\n",
    "        final int numberLength = 10;\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Local class defined inside the method\n",
    "        class PhoneNumber {\n",
    "            String formattedPhoneNumber = null;\n",
    "\n",
    "            PhoneNumber(String phoneNumber) {\n",
    "                String currentNumber = phoneNumber.replaceAll(regularExpression, \"\");\n",
    "                if (currentNumber.length() == numberLength)\n",
    "                    formattedPhoneNumber = currentNumber;\n",
    "                else\n",
    "                    formattedPhoneNumber = null;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "\n",
    "            public String getNumber() {\n",
    "                return formattedPhoneNumber;\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Using the local class\n",
    "        PhoneNumber myNumber1 = new PhoneNumber(phoneNumber1);\n",
    "        PhoneNumber myNumber2 = new PhoneNumber(phoneNumber2);\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Display results\n",
    "        if (myNumber1.getNumber() == null) \n",
    "            System.out.println(\"First number is invalid\");\n",
    "        else\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"First number is \" + myNumber1.getNumber());\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example validates phone numbers by removing non-digit characters and checking if exactly 10 digits remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Members of Enclosing Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Local classes have special access privileges:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access to Enclosing Class Members\n",
    "- Local classes can access all members (fields and methods) of their enclosing class\n",
    "- In the example above, `PhoneNumber` accesses `regularExpression` from `LocalClassExample`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access to Local Variables (Final/Effectively Final)\n",
    "Local classes can access local variables and parameters, but with restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Java 8:** Only `final` variables could be accessed\n",
    "```java\n",
    "final int numberLength = 10; // Must be explicitly final\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Java 8 and later:** Can access `final` or effectively final variables\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int numberLength = 10; // Effectively final (never changed after initialization)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What breaks effectively final:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "PhoneNumber(String phoneNumber) {\n",
    "    numberLength = 7; // This assignment makes numberLength NOT effectively final\n",
    "    // Compiler error: \"local variables referenced from an inner class must be final or effectively final\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access to Method Parameters (Java 8+)\n",
    "Local classes can access the enclosing method's parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void printOriginalNumbers() {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Original numbers are \" + phoneNumber1 + \" and \" + phoneNumber2);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shadowing in Local Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Local classes can shadow (hide) declarations from the enclosing scope that have the same name. This means if a local class declares a variable with the same name as one in the enclosing scope, the local class's variable takes precedence within that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Similarities to Inner Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Local classes share several characteristics with inner classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Member Restrictions\n",
    "- **Cannot declare static methods or variables** (with one exception)\n",
    "- **Cannot declare static initializers**\n",
    "- **Cannot declare member interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void sayGoodbyeInEnglish() {\n",
    "    class EnglishGoodbye {\n",
    "        public static void sayGoodbye() { // COMPILER ERROR\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"Bye bye\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exception: Static Constant Variables\n",
    "Local classes **can** have static members if they are constant variables (primitive types or String that are final and initialized with compile-time constants):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Valid example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void sayGoodbyeInEnglish() {\n",
    "    class EnglishGoodbye {\n",
    "        public static final String farewell = \"Bye bye\"; // This is allowed\n",
    "        \n",
    "        public void sayGoodbye() {\n",
    "            System.out.println(farewell);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    EnglishGoodbye myEnglishGoodbye = new EnglishGoodbye();\n",
    "    myEnglishGoodbye.sayGoodbye();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface Restrictions\n",
    "You cannot declare interfaces inside blocks because interfaces are inherently static:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void greetInEnglish() {\n",
    "    interface HelloThere { // COMPILER ERROR\n",
    "        public void greet();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access to Static vs Instance Members\n",
    "- Local classes in **static methods** can only access **static members** of the enclosing class\n",
    "- Local classes in **instance methods** can access both static and instance members\n",
    "- Local classes are non-static by nature because they need access to instance members of the enclosing block\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local classes** are defined within blocks and are scoped to that block\n",
    "2. They have access to enclosing class members and local final/effectively final variables\n",
    "3. They **cannot** have static methods, initializers, or member interfaces\n",
    "4. They **can** have static constant variables\n",
    "5. Variable access rules became more flexible in Java 8 with \"effectively final\" concept\n",
    "6. They're useful for encapsulating functionality that's only needed within a specific method or block"
