    "# Method Definition in Java: A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. Think of it like a recipe - it takes ingredients (parameters), follows steps (method body), and produces a result (return value).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Method Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Java method has this basic format:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public double calculateAnswer(double wingSpan, int numberOfEngines,\n",
    "                              double length, double grossTons) {\n",
    "    //do the calculation here\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple analogy**: Think of a method like a vending machine - you put money in (parameters), press a button (call the method), and get a snack out (return value).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Six Components of a Method Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Modifiers\n",
    "- **What it is**: Keywords that control access to the method\n",
    "- **Examples**: `public`, `private`\n",
    "- **Simple explanation**: Like a door lock - `public` means anyone can use it, `private` means only the same class can use it\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Return Type\n",
    "- **What it is**: The type of data the method gives back\n",
    "- **Examples**: `int`, `String`, `double`, or `void` (gives nothing back)\n",
    "- **Simple explanation**: Like specifying what kind of change a cashier should give you - coins, bills, or no change at all\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Method Name\n",
    "- **What it is**: The identifier you use to call the method\n",
    "- **Example**: `calculateAnswer`\n",
    "- **Simple explanation**: Like naming a contact in your phone - you need a name to call them\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Parameter List\n",
    "- **What it is**: Input values the method needs to work\n",
    "- **Example**: `(double wingSpan, int numberOfEngines, double length, double grossTons)`\n",
    "- **Simple explanation**: Like ingredients for a recipe - the method needs these to do its job\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Exception List\n",
    "- **What it is**: Potential errors the method might encounter (covered later)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Method Body\n",
    "- **What it is**: The actual code that does the work, enclosed in braces `{}`\n",
    "- **Simple explanation**: Like the step-by-step instructions in a recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "The **method signature** consists of just two parts:\n",
    "- Method name\n",
    "- Parameter types (not parameter names)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: For the method above, the signature is:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "calculateAnswer(double, int, double, double)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters**: Java uses the signature to tell different methods apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods should be named like actions using these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Word (verb in lowercase):\n",
    "- `run`\n",
    "- `jump` \n",
    "- `calculate`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Words (camelCase starting with lowercase verb):\n",
    "- `runFast`\n",
    "- `getBackground`\n",
    "- `getFinalData`\n",
    "- `compareTo`\n",
    "- `setX`\n",
    "- `isEmpty`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory tip**: Start with what the method **does** (verb), then add details (adjectives/nouns).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overloading means having multiple methods with the **same name** but **different parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Example:\n",
    "Imagine a printer that can print different things:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Printer {\n",
    "    public void print(String text) {\n",
    "        // Print text\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void print(int number) {\n",
    "        // Print number\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void print(String text, int copies) {\n",
    "        // Print text multiple times\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Java Tells Them Apart:\n",
    "Java looks at the **parameter list** to determine which method to call:\n",
    "- `print(\"Hello\")` → calls `print(String text)`\n",
    "- `print(42)` → calls `print(int number)`\n",
    "- `print(\"Hello\", 3)` → calls `print(String text, int copies)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rules for Overloading:\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Valid Overloading** (different parameter lists):\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void draw(String s) { }\n",
    "public void draw(int i) { }\n",
    "public void draw(int i, double f) { }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Invalid Overloading** (same parameters, different return type):\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void draw(String s) { }      // ❌ Won't compile\n",
    "public int draw(String s) { }       // ❌ Same signature\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Overloading is Useful:\n",
    "Instead of having methods like:\n",
    "- `drawString()`\n",
    "- `drawInteger()`\n",
    "- `drawDouble()`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can just have multiple `draw()` methods that work with different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caution:\n",
    "Use method overloading sparingly - too many overloaded methods can make code confusing to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Every method needs**: return type, name, parentheses, and body\n",
    "2. **Method signature**: name + parameter types (used by Java to identify methods)\n",
    "3. **Naming convention**: Start with lowercase verb, use camelCase for multiple words\n",
    "4. **Overloading**: Same name, different parameters - but use it wisely\n",
    "5. **Return type doesn't matter** for distinguishing overloaded methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of methods as specialized tools in a toolbox - each one has a specific job, a clear name, and the right inputs to get the job done efficiently."
