    "# Understanding Class Members in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This guide explains how to use the `static` keyword in Java to create fields and methods that belong to the class itself rather than to individual instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Variables (Static Fields)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Class Variables?\n",
    "- **Instance variables**: Each object has its own copy stored in different memory locations\n",
    "- **Class variables**: Shared by all objects of the class, stored in one fixed memory location\n",
    "- **Declaration**: Use the `static` modifier to create class variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Associated with the class, not individual objects\n",
    "- Every instance of the class shares the same class variable\n",
    "- Can be modified by any object\n",
    "- Can be accessed without creating an instance of the class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Bicycle Class with Serial Numbers\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Bicycle {\n",
    "    // Instance variables (each object has its own copy)\n",
    "    private int cadence;\n",
    "    private int gear;\n",
    "    private int speed;\n",
    "    private int id;  // unique to each bicycle\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Class variable (shared by all bicycles)\n",
    "    private static int numberOfBicycles = 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Class Variables\n",
    "**Recommended way** (using class name):\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Bicycle.numberOfBicycles  // Clear that it's a class variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discouraged way** (using object reference):\n",
    "```java\n",
    "myBike.numberOfBicycles  // Not clear that it's a class variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implementation\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {\n",
    "    gear = startGear;\n",
    "    cadence = startCadence;\n",
    "    speed = startSpeed;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Increment class variable and assign unique ID\n",
    "    id = ++numberOfBicycles;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Methods (Static Methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Class Methods?\n",
    "- Methods declared with the `static` modifier\n",
    "- Belong to the class rather than to any instance\n",
    "- Can be called without creating an object\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Class Methods\n",
    "**Recommended syntax**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "ClassName.methodName(args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Bicycle.getNumberOfBicycles()  // No object needed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Case\n",
    "Static methods are often used to access static fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static int getNumberOfBicycles() {\n",
    "    return numberOfBicycles;  // Accessing class variable\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access Rules for Class Members\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Instance Methods Can Access\n",
    "- ✅ Instance variables directly\n",
    "- ✅ Instance methods directly\n",
    "- ✅ Class variables directly\n",
    "- ✅ Class methods directly\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Class Methods Can Access\n",
    "- ✅ Class variables directly\n",
    "- ✅ Class methods directly\n",
    "- ❌ Instance variables directly (must use object reference)\n",
    "- ❌ Instance methods directly (must use object reference)\n",
    "- ❌ `this` keyword (no instance to refer to)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Restrictions\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void someStaticMethod() {\n",
    "    numberOfBicycles++;  // ✅ OK - accessing class variable\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // cadence++;  // ❌ ERROR - cannot access instance variable directly\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // To access instance variables, need an object reference:\n",
    "    Bicycle bike = new Bicycle(10, 5, 3);\n",
    "    bike.setCadence(15);  // ✅ OK - using object reference\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Constants\n",
    "Use `static final` modifiers together:\n",
    "- `static`: Belongs to the class\n",
    "- `final`: Value cannot be changed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```java\n",
    "static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Convention\n",
    "- Use UPPERCASE letters\n",
    "- Separate multiple words with underscores\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "static final int MAX_SPEED = 100;\n",
    "static final String DEFAULT_COLOR = \"RED\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compile-time Constants\n",
    "- For primitive types and strings with known values at compile time\n",
    "- Compiler replaces constant name with its value throughout the code\n",
    "- If the constant value changes, classes using it must be recompiled\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complete Bicycle Class Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Bicycle {\n",
    "    // Instance variables\n",
    "    private int cadence;\n",
    "    private int gear;\n",
    "    private int speed;\n",
    "    private int id;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Class variable\n",
    "    private static int numberOfBicycles = 0;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructor\n",
    "    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {\n",
    "        gear = startGear;\n",
    "        cadence = startCadence;\n",
    "        speed = startSpeed;\n",
    "        id = ++numberOfBicycles;  // Assign unique ID\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Instance method to get ID\n",
    "    public int getID() {\n",
    "        return id;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Class method to get total number of bicycles\n",
    "    public static int getNumberOfBicycles() {\n",
    "        return numberOfBicycles;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Other instance methods\n",
    "    public int getCadence() { return cadence; }\n",
    "    public void setCadence(int newValue) { cadence = newValue; }\n",
    "    public int getGear() { return gear; }\n",
    "    public void setGear(int newValue) { gear = newValue; }\n",
    "    public int getSpeed() { return speed; }\n",
    "    public void applyBrake(int decrement) { speed -= decrement; }\n",
    "    public void speedUp(int increment) { speed += increment; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Create bicycles\n",
    "Bicycle bike1 = new Bicycle(10, 5, 3);\n",
    "Bicycle bike2 = new Bicycle(15, 8, 5);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Access instance variables through objects\n",
    "System.out.println(\"Bike 1 ID: \" + bike1.getID());  // Output: 1\n",
    "System.out.println(\"Bike 2 ID: \" + bike2.getID());  // Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "// Access class variable through class name\n",
    "System.out.println(\"Total bicycles: \" + Bicycle.getNumberOfBicycles());  // Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance variables**: Each object has its own copy\n",
    "2. **Class variables**: Shared by all objects, accessed via class name\n",
    "3. **Class methods**: Can be called without creating objects\n",
    "4. **Access restrictions**: Static methods can't directly access instance members\n",
    "5. **Constants**: Use `static final` with UPPERCASE naming\n",
    "6. **Best practice**: Use class name to access static members for clarity"
