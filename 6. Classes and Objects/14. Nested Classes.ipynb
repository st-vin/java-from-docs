    "# Java Nested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Nested Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **nested class** is a class defined within another class. Java allows you to place one class inside another class, creating a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class OuterClass {\n",
    "    // Outer class members\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class NestedClass {\n",
    "        // Nested class members\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Nested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Java categorizes nested classes into two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Non-Static Nested Classes (Inner Classes)\n",
    "- Called **inner classes**\n",
    "- Have access to all members of the outer class (including private ones)\n",
    "- Cannot exist without an instance of the outer class\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Static Nested Classes\n",
    "- Declared with the `static` keyword\n",
    "- Do not have access to instance members of the outer class\n",
    "- Can exist independently of outer class instances\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class OuterClass {\n",
    "    class InnerClass {           // Non-static (inner class)\n",
    "        // Can access all outer class members\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    static class StaticNestedClass {  // Static nested class\n",
    "        // Cannot directly access outer instance members\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Nested Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Logical Grouping\n",
    "- Keep helper classes that are only used in one place close to where they're needed\n",
    "- Makes the code package more organized and streamlined\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Enhanced Encapsulation\n",
    "- Inner classes can access private members of the outer class\n",
    "- The nested class itself can be hidden from the outside world\n",
    "- Creates tighter encapsulation boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Better Code Organization\n",
    "- Places code closer to where it's used\n",
    "- Results in more readable and maintainable code\n",
    "- Reduces namespace pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inner Classes (Non-Static)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Associated with an **instance** of the outer class\n",
    "- Have direct access to all outer class methods and fields (including private ones)\n",
    "- Cannot define static members themselves\n",
    "- Must exist within an instance of the outer class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Inner Class Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// First create the outer class instance\n",
    "OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Then create the inner class instance\n",
    "OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class OuterClass {\n",
    "    private String outerField = \"Outer field\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class InnerClass {\n",
    "        void accessMembers() {\n",
    "            // Direct access to outer class members\n",
    "            System.out.println(outerField);  // Works fine!\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static Nested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Associated with the **outer class** itself, not instances\n",
    "- Cannot directly access instance variables or methods of the outer class\n",
    "- Can only access outer class members through object references\n",
    "- Behave like top-level classes but are nested for packaging convenience\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Static Nested Class Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Can be instantiated directly, like a top-level class\n",
    "StaticNestedClass staticNestedObject = new StaticNestedClass();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class OuterClass {\n",
    "    private String outerField = \"Outer field\";\n",
    "    private static String staticOuterField = \"Static outer field\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    static class StaticNestedClass {\n",
    "        void accessMembers(OuterClass outer) {\n",
    "            // Cannot directly access outerField\n",
    "            // System.out.println(outerField);  // Compiler error!\n",
    "            \n",
    "            // Must use object reference\n",
    "            System.out.println(outer.outerField);  // Works!\n",
    "            \n",
    "            // Can access static members directly\n",
    "            System.out.println(staticOuterField);  // Works!\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complete Working Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a comprehensive example showing the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class OuterClass {\n",
    "    String outerField = \"Outer field\";\n",
    "    static String staticOuterField = \"Static outer field\";\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Inner class\n",
    "    class InnerClass {\n",
    "        void accessMembers() {\n",
    "            System.out.println(outerField);        // Direct access\n",
    "            System.out.println(staticOuterField);  // Direct access\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Static nested class\n",
    "    static class StaticNestedClass {\n",
    "        void accessMembers(OuterClass outer) {\n",
    "            System.out.println(outer.outerField);  // Through object reference\n",
    "            System.out.println(staticOuterField);  // Direct access to static\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        // Using inner class\n",
    "        OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass();\n",
    "        OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();\n",
    "        innerObject.accessMembers();\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Using static nested class\n",
    "        StaticNestedClass staticNestedObject = new StaticNestedClass();\n",
    "        staticNestedObject.accessMembers(outerObject);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Shadowing\n",
    "\n",
    "When variables in different scopes have the same name, the inner scope \"shadows\" the outer scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class ShadowTest {\n",
    "    public int x = 0;  // Outer class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    class FirstLevel {\n",
    "        public int x = 1;  // Inner class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "        void methodInFirstLevel(int x) {  // Method parameter\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"x = \" + x);                    // Method parameter (23)\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"this.x = \" + this.x);          // Inner class variable (1)\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"ShadowTest.this.x = \" + ShadowTest.this.x); // Outer class variable (0)\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Shadowed Variables\n",
    "- `x` - refers to the method parameter\n",
    "- `this.x` - refers to the inner class member variable\n",
    "- `OuterClass.this.x` - refers to the outer class member variable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special Types of Inner Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The document mentions two special kinds of inner classes:\n",
    "- **Local classes** - classes defined within methods\n",
    "- **Anonymous classes** - classes without names, often used for event handling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Modifiers\n",
    "- Nested classes can be declared with any access modifier: `private`, `protected`, `public`, or package-private\n",
    "- Outer classes can only be `public` or package-private\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serialization Warning\n",
    "- Serialization of inner classes is **strongly discouraged**\n",
    "- Java compilers create synthetic constructs for inner classes\n",
    "- These synthetic constructs can vary between different compiler implementations\n",
    "- This can lead to compatibility issues when deserializing with different JRE implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Inner Class | Static Nested Class | Top-Level Class |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Access to outer instance members | ✅ Direct | ❌ Only through object reference | ❌ Only through object reference |\n",
    "| Access to outer static members | ✅ Direct | ✅ Direct | ✅ Direct |\n",
    "| Can exist without outer instance | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n",
    "| Can have static members | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |\n",
    "| Instantiation | Requires outer instance | Independent | Independent |\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested classes are powerful tools for creating well-organized, encapsulated Java code. Choose inner classes when you need tight coupling with the outer class instance, and static nested classes when you want logical grouping without instance dependency."
