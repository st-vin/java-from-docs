    "# Java Nested Classes, Local Classes, Anonymous Classes, and Lambda Expressions Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Java provides several ways to define classes and behavior within other classes or methods. Each approach serves specific use cases and offers different advantages for code organization, encapsulation, and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Each Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Local Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- You need to create **multiple instances** of a class\n",
    "- You need access to the class **constructor**\n",
    "- You want to introduce a **new, named type** for later method invocations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void processData() {\n",
    "    // Local class defined inside a method\n",
    "    class DataProcessor {\n",
    "        private String name;\n",
    "        \n",
    "        public DataProcessor(String name) {\n",
    "            this.name = name;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        \n",
    "        public void process() {\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"Processing: \" + name);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Create multiple instances\n",
    "    DataProcessor processor1 = new DataProcessor(\"File1\");\n",
    "    DataProcessor processor2 = new DataProcessor(\"File2\");\n",
    "    \n",
    "    processor1.process();\n",
    "    processor2.process();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Anonymous Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- You need to **declare fields** or **additional methods**\n",
    "- You're implementing an interface or extending a class with custom behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Anonymous class implementing Runnable with additional fields/methods\n",
    "Runnable task = new Runnable() {\n",
    "    private int taskId = 123; // Additional field\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    public void run() {\n",
    "        executeTask();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    private void executeTask() { // Additional method\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Executing task: \" + taskId);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "new Thread(task).start();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Lambda Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Encapsulating a **single unit of behavior** to pass to other code\n",
    "- Performing actions on collection elements, handling process completion, or error handling\n",
    "- You need a **simple instance of a functional interface**\n",
    "- You don't need constructors, named types, fields, or additional methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Lambda for collection processing\n",
    "List<String> names = Arrays.asList(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\");\n",
    "names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(\"Hello, \" + name));\n",
    "\n",
    "// Lambda for event handling\n",
    "button.addActionListener(event -> System.out.println(\"Button clicked!\"));\n",
    "\n",
    "// Lambda for error handling\n",
    "CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> riskyOperation())\n",
    "    .exceptionally(error -> {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Error occurred: \" + error.getMessage());\n",
    "        return \"Default value\";\n",
    "    });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Nested Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Requirements are similar to local classes\n",
    "- You want to make the type **more widely available** (not just within a method)\n",
    "- You **don't require access** to local variables or method parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static Nested Classes\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- You **don't need access** to the enclosing instance's non-public fields and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class OuterClass {\n",
    "    private static String staticField = \"Static data\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Static nested class - doesn't need outer instance\n",
    "    public static class StaticNestedClass {\n",
    "        public void display() {\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"Accessing: \" + staticField);\n",
    "            // Cannot access non-static outer fields directly\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nested = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();\n",
    "nested.display();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Static Nested Classes (Inner Classes)\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- You **require access** to the enclosing instance's non-public fields and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class OuterClass {\n",
    "    private String instanceField = \"Instance data\";\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Inner class - has access to outer instance\n",
    "    public class InnerClass {\n",
    "        public void display() {\n",
    "            System.out.println(\"Accessing: \" + instanceField);\n",
    "            // Can access outer instance fields and methods\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();\n",
    "OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();\n",
    "inner.display();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "All these approaches provide:\n",
    "- **Logical grouping** of classes used in specific contexts\n",
    "- **Increased encapsulation** by keeping related code together\n",
    "- **More readable and maintainable code** through better organization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Need multiple instances or constructor access?** → Use **Local Class**\n",
    "2. **Need additional fields or methods beyond interface requirements?** → Use **Anonymous Class**\n",
    "3. **Simple single behavior for functional interface?** → Use **Lambda Expression**\n",
    "4. **Need wider availability than method scope?** → Use **Nested Class**\n",
    "   - Need access to outer instance? → **Inner Class** (non-static)\n",
    "   - Don't need outer instance access? → **Static Nested Class**"
