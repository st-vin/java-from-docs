    "# Java Variables and Member Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Variables in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Java has three main types of variables, each serving different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Member Variables (Fields)\n",
    "These are variables declared inside a class but outside any method. They represent the properties or attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Local Variables\n",
    "These are variables declared inside a method or block of code. They exist only while that method or block is executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Parameters\n",
    "These are variables in method declarations that receive values when the method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Java Class Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic `Car` class that demonstrates all three types of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Car {\n",
    "    // Member variables (fields)\n",
    "    private String brand;\n",
    "    private int year;\n",
    "    private double speed;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructor with parameters\n",
    "    public Car(String carBrand, int carYear) {\n",
    "        brand = carBrand;  // parameter values assigned to fields\n",
    "        year = carYear;\n",
    "        speed = 0.0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Method with parameter and local variable\n",
    "    public void accelerate(int increment) {  // 'increment' is a parameter\n",
    "        double maxSpeed = 120.0;  // 'maxSpeed' is a local variable\n",
    "        if (speed + increment <= maxSpeed) {\n",
    "            speed += increment;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Field Declaration Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Every field declaration has three parts in this exact order:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Modifiers (Optional)\n",
    "These control access and behavior:\n",
    "- **public**: Accessible from any class\n",
    "- **private**: Accessible only within the same class\n",
    "- **static**: Belongs to the class rather than instances\n",
    "- **final**: Cannot be changed after initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Type\n",
    "This specifies what kind of data the variable can hold:\n",
    "- **Primitive types**: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`\n",
    "- **Reference types**: `String`, arrays, objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Variable Name\n",
    "Must follow Java naming conventions:\n",
    "- Start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign\n",
    "- Use camelCase for variables and methods\n",
    "- Use PascalCase for class names\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access Modifiers Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Access\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int speed;  // Any class can access this field directly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Access (Recommended)\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private int speed;  // Only this class can access this field directly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use private?** This follows the principle of **encapsulation** - hiding internal details and controlling how data is accessed and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Complete Bicycle Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Bicycle class demonstrates proper encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Bicycle {\n",
    "    // Private fields - hidden from outside access\n",
    "    private int cadence;\n",
    "    private int gear;\n",
    "    private int speed;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructor to initialize the bicycle\n",
    "    public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {\n",
    "        cadence = startCadence;\n",
    "        speed = startSpeed;\n",
    "        gear = startGear;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Getter methods - provide controlled access to private fields\n",
    "    public int getCadence() { return cadence; }\n",
    "    public int getGear() { return gear; }\n",
    "    public int getSpeed() { return speed; }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Setter method - allows controlled modification\n",
    "    public void setCadence(int newValue) {\n",
    "        cadence = newValue;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Action methods - perform operations on the data\n",
    "    public void applyBrake(int decrement) {\n",
    "        speed -= decrement;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void speedUp(int increment) {\n",
    "        speed += increment;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the `void` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "The `void` keyword appears in several methods above. **`void` means the method doesn't return any value.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- `public void setCadence(int newValue)` - This method performs an action but doesn't give back any data\n",
    "- `public int getCadence()` - This method returns an integer value\n",
    "- `public void applyBrake(int decrement)` - This method changes the speed but doesn't return anything\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like instructions:**\n",
    "- `void` methods are like \"Do this action\" (set the cadence, apply brakes)\n",
    "- Non-void methods are like \"Give me this information\" (what's the current speed?)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Conventions Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables and Methods\n",
    "- Use **camelCase**: `currentSpeed`, `getCadence()`, `applyBrake()`\n",
    "- Method names should start with a **verb**: `get`, `set`, `calculate`, `display`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "- Use **PascalCase**: `Bicycle`, `Car`, `BankAccount`\n",
    "- Should be **nouns** representing objects or concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Private fields protect data from unauthorized access\n",
    "2. **Control**: Getter/setter methods allow validation and controlled access\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Internal implementation can change without affecting other classes\n",
    "4. **Debugging**: Easier to track where and how data is modified\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure creates robust, maintainable code that follows Java best practices."
