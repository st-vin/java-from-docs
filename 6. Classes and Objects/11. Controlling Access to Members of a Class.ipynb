    "# Java Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control in Java determines which parts of your code can be accessed by other classes. It's like having different levels of security clearance - some information is public to everyone, while other information is restricted to specific groups or kept completely private.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Levels of Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Top Level (Classes)\n",
    "- **public**: Class is visible to all classes everywhere\n",
    "- **package-private** (no modifier): Class is only visible within its own package\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Member Level (Fields and Methods)\n",
    "Four access levels available for class members:\n",
    "- **public**\n",
    "- **protected** \n",
    "- **package-private** (no modifier)\n",
    "- **private**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access Modifiers Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### public\n",
    "- **Who can access**: Everyone, everywhere\n",
    "- **Example**: A utility method that should be available to all classes\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Calculator {\n",
    "    public int add(int a, int b) {\n",
    "        return a + b;  // Anyone can use this method\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### protected\n",
    "- **Who can access**: Same package + subclasses in other packages\n",
    "- **Example**: A method that subclasses might need to override or access\n",
    "```java\n",
    "protected void validateInput() {\n",
    "    // Subclasses can access this method even from other packages\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### package-private (no modifier)\n",
    "- **Who can access**: Only classes in the same package\n",
    "- **Example**: Helper methods used internally within a package\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void helperMethod() {\n",
    "    // Only classes in this package can access this method\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### private\n",
    "- **Who can access**: Only the same class\n",
    "- **Example**: Internal implementation details\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private String internalData;  // Only this class can access this field\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access Level Summary Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Modifier | Same Class | Same Package | Subclass (Other Package) | Everywhere |\n",
    "|----------|------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------|\n",
    "| `public` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n",
    "| `protected` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n",
    "| no modifier | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n",
    "| `private` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a banking system with different classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Package: com.bank.core\n",
    "public class BankAccount {\n",
    "    private double balance;           // Only BankAccount can access\n",
    "    protected String accountType;     // Same package + subclasses elsewhere\n",
    "    String bankCode;                  // Only classes in com.bank.core package\n",
    "    public String getAccountNumber(); // Everyone can access\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Package: com.bank.core  \n",
    "class TransactionProcessor {\n",
    "    // Can access: accountType, bankCode, getAccountNumber()\n",
    "    // Cannot access: balance\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Package: com.bank.savings\n",
    "class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount {\n",
    "    // Can access: accountType, getAccountNumber()\n",
    "    // Cannot access: balance, bankCode\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Package: com.external.app\n",
    "class ExternalApp {\n",
    "    // Can only access: getAccountNumber()\n",
    "    // Cannot access: balance, accountType, bankCode\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use Most Restrictive Access Level\n",
    "Start with `private` and only make it more accessible if needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class User {\n",
    "    private String password;      // Good: Internal only\n",
    "    private void hashPassword();  // Good: Internal helper method\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public String getUsername();  // Good: Needed by other classes\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Avoid Public Fields\n",
    "Instead of exposing fields directly, use getter/setter methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// ❌ Avoid this\n",
    "public class Student {\n",
    "    public String name;  // Direct access, hard to validate or change later\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// ✅ Prefer this\n",
    "public class Student {\n",
    "    private String name;  // Protected from direct access\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public String getName() {\n",
    "        return name;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void setName(String name) {\n",
    "        if (name != null && !name.trim().isEmpty()) {\n",
    "            this.name = name;  // Can add validation\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Exception: Constants Can Be Public\n",
    "Constants (final static fields) are safe to make public:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MathConstants {\n",
    "    public static final double PI = 3.14159;  // OK: It's a constant\n",
    "    public static final int MAX_USERS = 1000; // OK: Won't change\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Access Control Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prevents Misuse**: Restricts how other programmers can use your code\n",
    "2. **Maintains Flexibility**: You can change private implementation without breaking other code\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation**: Hides internal details and exposes only what's necessary\n",
    "4. **Security**: Sensitive data and methods can't be accessed inappropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Decision Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding on access level, ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does everyone need this?** → `public`\n",
    "- **Do only subclasses need this?** → `protected`  \n",
    "- **Do only classes in my package need this?** → package-private (no modifier)\n",
    "- **Do only I need this?** → `private`\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: You can always make something more accessible later, but making it more restrictive might break existing code that depends on it."
