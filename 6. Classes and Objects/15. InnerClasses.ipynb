    "# Java Inner Classes \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Inner Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner classes in Java are classes defined inside another class. They provide a way to logically group classes that are only used in one place, making code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complete Example Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DataStructure Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The example demonstrates a `DataStructure` class that:\n",
    "- Creates an array of 15 integers (0, 1, 2, 3... 14)\n",
    "- Uses an inner class to iterate through and print only even-indexed values\n",
    "- Outputs: `0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Outer Class (`DataStructure`)\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class DataStructure {\n",
    "    private final static int SIZE = 15;\n",
    "    private int[] arrayOfInts = new int[SIZE];\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructor fills array with consecutive integers\n",
    "    public DataStructure() {\n",
    "        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {\n",
    "            arrayOfInts[i] = i;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Inner Class (`EvenIterator`)\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private class EvenIterator implements DataStructureIterator {\n",
    "    private int nextIndex = 0;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public boolean hasNext() {\n",
    "        return (nextIndex <= SIZE - 1);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public Integer next() {\n",
    "        Integer retValue = Integer.valueOf(arrayOfInts[nextIndex]);\n",
    "        nextIndex += 2;  // Skip to next even index\n",
    "        return retValue;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Advantages of Inner Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Direct Access to Outer Class Members**\n",
    "- The `EvenIterator` can directly access `arrayOfInts` from the outer class\n",
    "- No need for getters/setters or passing references\n",
    "- Simplified code structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Logical Grouping**\n",
    "- Helper classes stay close to where they're used\n",
    "- Better code organization and encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Access Control**\n",
    "- Inner classes can be `private`, hiding implementation details\n",
    "- Only the outer class can create instances\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Inner Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Regular Inner Classes** (shown in example)\n",
    "- Declared inside a class but outside methods\n",
    "- Have access to all outer class members\n",
    "- Cannot contain static members (except constants)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Local Classes**\n",
    "- Declared inside a method body\n",
    "- Can access method parameters and local variables (if effectively final)\n",
    "- Limited scope to the method where they're defined\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Anonymous Classes**\n",
    "- Declared and instantiated in a single expression\n",
    "- No explicit class name\n",
    "- Often used for implementing interfaces or extending classes inline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifiers for Inner Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner classes can use the same access modifiers as regular class members:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`private`**: Only accessible within the outer class\n",
    "- **`public`**: Accessible from anywhere\n",
    "- **`protected`**: Accessible within the package and subclasses\n",
    "- **`static`**: Creates a nested class (doesn't need outer class instance)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Event Handling in GUI Applications**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n",
    "    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n",
    "        // Handle button click\n",
    "    }\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Iterator Pattern Implementation**\n",
    "- As shown in the example\n",
    "- Provides controlled access to data structures\n",
    "- Encapsulates traversal logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Helper Classes**\n",
    "- Utility classes that support the main class functionality\n",
    "- Keep related code together\n",
    "- Maintain clean public interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Memory Aid\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of inner classes like **rooms inside a house**:\n",
    "- The **outer class** is the house\n",
    "- **Inner classes** are rooms that can access all parts of the house\n",
    "- **Local classes** are temporary spaces created inside specific rooms (methods)\n",
    "- **Anonymous classes** are unnamed spaces used for specific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use inner classes for helper functionality** that's closely tied to the outer class\n",
    "2. **Keep inner classes small and focused** on a single responsibility\n",
    "3. **Consider static nested classes** if you don't need access to outer class instance variables\n",
    "4. **Use anonymous classes** for simple, one-time implementations (like event handlers)\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure promotes better encapsulation, cleaner code organization, and more maintainable Java applications."
