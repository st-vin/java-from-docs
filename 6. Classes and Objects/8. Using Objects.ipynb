    "# Using Objects in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Once you create an object in Java, you need to interact with it by accessing its fields (attributes) and calling its methods (functions). This document explains how to properly reference and use objects in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Object Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Names (Within the Same Class)\n",
    "When you're writing code inside a class, you can directly reference the class's fields by their simple names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Car {\n",
    "    String model;\n",
    "    int year;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void displayInfo() {\n",
    "        // Using simple names within the same class\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Model: \" + model + \", Year: \" + year);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Reference (Outside the Class)\n",
    "When accessing fields from outside the class, you must use the object reference followed by the dot operator and the field name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:** `objectReference.fieldName`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class CarDemo {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        Car myCar = new Car();\n",
    "        myCar.model = \"Toyota\";\n",
    "        myCar.year = 2023;\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Accessing fields from outside the class\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"My car model: \" + myCar.model);\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"My car year: \" + myCar.year);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes About Field Access\n",
    "- Each object has its own copy of instance fields\n",
    "- Multiple objects of the same class have separate field values\n",
    "- You can use expressions that return object references to access fields\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with Multiple Objects:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Car car1 = new Car();\n",
    "Car car2 = new Car();\n",
    "\n",
    "car1.model = \"Honda\";\n",
    "car1.year = 2022;\n",
    "\n",
    "car2.model = \"Ford\";\n",
    "car2.year = 2021;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Each object has its own field values\n",
    "System.out.println(car1.model); // Prints: Honda\n",
    "System.out.println(car2.model); // Prints: Ford\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Field Access with New Objects\n",
    "You can access fields immediately after creating an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Creating object and accessing field in one statement\n",
    "String carModel = new Car().model; // Gets the default value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling Object Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Invocation Syntax\n",
    "To call a method on an object, use the object reference, dot operator, method name, and parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:** \n",
    "- `objectReference.methodName(arguments);`\n",
    "- `objectReference.methodName();` (for methods without parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class with Methods:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class BankAccount {\n",
    "    private double balance;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void deposit(double amount) {\n",
    "        balance += amount;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public double getBalance() {\n",
    "        return balance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void transfer(BankAccount targetAccount, double amount) {\n",
    "        this.balance -= amount;\n",
    "        targetAccount.balance += amount;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the Methods:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class BankDemo {\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        BankAccount account1 = new BankAccount();\n",
    "        BankAccount account2 = new BankAccount();\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Calling methods with parameters\n",
    "        account1.deposit(1000.0);\n",
    "        account2.deposit(500.0);\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Calling method without parameters\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Account1 balance: \" + account1.getBalance());\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Method that takes another object as parameter\n",
    "        account1.transfer(account2, 200.0);\n",
    "        \n",
    "        System.out.println(\"After transfer:\");\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Account1: \" + account1.getBalance()); // 800.0\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"Account2: \" + account2.getBalance()); // 700.0\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods That Return Values\n",
    "Methods can return values that you can use in various ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Calculator {\n",
    "    public int add(int a, int b) {\n",
    "        return a + b;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public double calculateArea(double radius) {\n",
    "        return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage examples:\n",
    "Calculator calc = new Calculator();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Assign return value to variable\n",
    "int sum = calc.add(10, 20);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use in expressions\n",
    "if (calc.add(5, 7) > 10) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Sum is greater than 10\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use directly in output\n",
    "System.out.println(\"Circle area: \" + calc.calculateArea(5.0));\n",
    "\n",
    "// Chain with new object creation\n",
    "double area = new Calculator().calculateArea(3.0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Management and Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Memory Management\n",
    "Java automatically manages memory through a process called **garbage collection**. You don't need to manually delete objects like in some other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Objects Become Eligible for Garbage Collection\n",
    "An object becomes eligible for garbage collection when:\n",
    "1. There are no more references pointing to it\n",
    "2. All variables referencing it go out of scope\n",
    "3. References are explicitly set to `null`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Garbage Collection Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1 - Variable Goes Out of Scope:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void someMethod() {\n",
    "    Student student = new Student(\"John\", 20);\n",
    "    // student is used here\n",
    "} // student goes out of scope, object eligible for garbage collection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2 - Explicit Null Assignment:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Student student1 = new Student(\"Alice\", 19);\n",
    "Student student2 = student1; // Both variables point to same object\n",
    "\n",
    "student1 = null; // Object still referenced by student2\n",
    "student2 = null; // Now object is eligible for garbage collection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 3 - Temporary Objects:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Object created and immediately used, then becomes eligible for GC\n",
    "int area = new Calculator().calculateArea(10.0);\n",
    "// The Calculator object has no references after this line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple References Example\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Book book1 = new Book(\"Java Programming\");\n",
    "Book book2 = book1; // Both variables reference the same object\n",
    "Book book3 = book1; // Three references to the same object\n",
    "\n",
    "book1 = null; // Still 2 references remaining\n",
    "book2 = null; // Still 1 reference remaining  \n",
    "book3 = null; // Now 0 references - eligible for garbage collection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Field Access**: Use simple names within the same class, object references outside the class\n",
    "2. **Method Invocation**: Always use object reference, dot operator, and method name with parentheses\n",
    "3. **Object Independence**: Each object has its own copy of instance fields\n",
    "4. **Memory Management**: Java automatically handles memory cleanup through garbage collection\n",
    "5. **Reference Tracking**: Objects are only garbage collected when all references to them are removed\n",
    "6. **Expression Usage**: You can use any expression that returns an object reference to access fields or call methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always ensure proper object initialization before accessing fields\n",
    "- Be mindful of null references to avoid `NullPointerException`\n",
    "- Understand that garbage collection happens automatically but unpredictably\n",
    "- Use meaningful variable names for object references to improve code readability\n",
    "- Remember that method calls can be chained when methods return objects"
