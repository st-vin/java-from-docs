    "# Java Enum Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Enum Types?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **enum type** is a special data type in Java that allows a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable can only be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Examples\n",
    "- Compass directions: `NORTH`, `SOUTH`, `EAST`, `WEST`\n",
    "- Days of the week: `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, etc.\n",
    "- Menu choices, command line flags, planets in our solar system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- Enum field names are written in **UPPERCASE LETTERS** because they are constants\n",
    "- Use enums when you need to represent a **fixed set of constants**\n",
    "- All possible values must be known at **compile time**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Enum Declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "You define an enum using the `enum` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public enum Day {\n",
    "    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,\n",
    "    THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Enums in Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a practical example showing how to use the `Day` enum:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class EnumTest {\n",
    "    Day day;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public EnumTest(Day day) {\n",
    "        this.day = day;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void tellItLikeItIs() {\n",
    "        switch (day) {\n",
    "            case MONDAY:\n",
    "                System.out.println(\"Mondays are bad.\");\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "            case FRIDAY:\n",
    "                System.out.println(\"Fridays are better.\");\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "            case SATURDAY: \n",
    "            case SUNDAY:\n",
    "                System.out.println(\"Weekends are best.\");\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "            default:\n",
    "                System.out.println(\"Midweek days are so-so.\");\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output when run:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mondays are bad.\n",
    "Midweek days are so-so.\n",
    "Fridays are better.\n",
    "Weekends are best.\n",
    "Weekends are best.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Enum Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Java Enums vs Other Languages\n",
    "Java enums are much more powerful than enums in other programming languages because:\n",
    "- The enum declaration defines a **class** (called an enum type)\n",
    "- Enum classes can include **methods and fields**\n",
    "- The compiler automatically adds special methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Methods\n",
    "- **`values()`**: Returns an array of all enum values in declaration order\n",
    "- Used commonly with for-each loops to iterate over enum values\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (Planet p : Planet.values()) {\n",
    "    System.out.printf(\"Your weight on %s is %f%n\",\n",
    "                      p, p.surfaceWeight(mass));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Inheritance Rules\n",
    "- All enums implicitly extend `java.lang.Enum`\n",
    "- Since Java only supports single inheritance, **enums cannot extend anything else**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complex Enum Example: Planet Enum\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a sophisticated example that demonstrates enums with fields, constructors, and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public enum Planet {\n",
    "    MERCURY (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6),\n",
    "    VENUS   (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6),\n",
    "    EARTH   (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6),\n",
    "    MARS    (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6),\n",
    "    JUPITER (1.9e+27,   7.1492e7),\n",
    "    SATURN  (5.688e+26, 6.0268e7),\n",
    "    URANUS  (8.686e+25, 2.5559e7),\n",
    "    NEPTUNE (1.024e+26, 2.4746e7);\n",
    "\n",
    "    private final double mass;   // in kilograms\n",
    "    private final double radius; // in meters\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Constructor\n",
    "    Planet(double mass, double radius) {\n",
    "        this.mass = mass;\n",
    "        this.radius = radius;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Getter methods\n",
    "    private double mass() { return mass; }\n",
    "    private double radius() { return radius; }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Universal gravitational constant\n",
    "    public static final double G = 6.67300E-11;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Calculate surface gravity\n",
    "    double surfaceGravity() {\n",
    "        return G * mass / (radius * radius);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Calculate weight on this planet\n",
    "    double surfaceWeight(double otherMass) {\n",
    "        return otherMass * surfaceGravity();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Structure Rules for Complex Enums\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constants must be defined first** before any fields or methods\n",
    "2. When there are fields and methods, the **list of enum constants must end with a semicolon**\n",
    "3. **Constructor must be package-private or private** - you cannot invoke it yourself\n",
    "4. The constructor automatically creates the constants defined at the beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Usage and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the Planet example with weight 175:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ java Planet 175\n",
    "Your weight on MERCURY is 66.107583\n",
    "Your weight on VENUS is 158.374842\n",
    "Your weight on EARTH is 175.000000\n",
    "Your weight on MARS is 66.279007\n",
    "Your weight on JUPITER is 442.847567\n",
    "Your weight on SATURN is 186.552719\n",
    "Your weight on URANUS is 158.397260\n",
    "Your weight on NEPTUNE is 199.207413\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Enums\n",
    "\n",
    "Use enum types whenever you need to represent a **fixed set of constants**, including:\n",
    "- Natural enum types (planets, days, directions)\n",
    "- Data sets where you know all possible values at compile time\n",
    "- Menu choices\n",
    "- Command line flags\n",
    "- Status codes\n",
    "- Configuration options\n",
    "\n",
    "Enums make your code more **readable, maintainable, and type-safe** compared to using regular constants or strings."
