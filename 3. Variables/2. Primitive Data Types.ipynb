    "# Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java programming language is statically-typed, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used. This involves stating the variable's type and name, as you've already seen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int gear = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing so tells your program that a field named \"gear\" exists, holds numerical data, and has an initial value of \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable's data type **determines** the **values** it may contain, plus the **operations** that may be performed on it. In addition to int, the Java programming language supports seven other primitive data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Primitive values do not share state with other primitive values**\n",
    "\n",
    "What “Sharing State” Means\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pass a variable (regardless of its type) to a function or method, the original variable is copied and sent to the function. If the function modifies the copied variable, those changes are reflected in the original variable. This is \"sharing state\" – the original variable is affected by the changes made inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works with Primitive Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Because primitive types are pass by value, a copy of the primitive value is created and passed to the function. Any changes made to that copy inside the function do not affect the original primitive variable outside the function. The copy is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Example {\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "        int x = 5;\n",
    "        int y = x; // y gets a *copy* of the value of x\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"x: \" + x); // Output: x: 5\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"y: \" + y); // Output: y: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "        y = 10; // Modifying y does *not* affect x\n",
    "\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"x: \" + x); // Output: x: 5\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, when you assign y = 10;, you're assigning the value 10 to a copy of the value stored in y. Because x and y hold separate copies, changing y doesn't impact x.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contrast with Object Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the opposite of what happens with object types. When you pass an object to a method, you're actually passing a reference to the object’s memory location. Therefore, if you modify the object's state through that reference, the changes will be visible outside the function, because you're working with the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Primitive Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. byte\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: An 8-bit signed two's complement integer.\n",
    "- Range: Minimum value of -128, Maximum value of 127 (inclusive).\n",
    "- Declaration: `byte score = 23;`\n",

    "- Range: Minimum value of -2<sup>31</sup>, Maximum value of 2<sup>31</sup>-1.\n",
    "- Declaration: `int count = 100;`\n",
    "- Default Value: 0\n",
    "- Unsigned Integer Support: Can be used to represent unsigned integers from 0 to 232-1. Requires using the Integer class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. long\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: A 64-bit two's complement integer.\n",
    "- Range: Minimum value of -2<sup>63</sup>, Maximum value of 2<sup>63</sup>-1.\n",
    "- Declaration: `long pi = 3.14159L;` (Note the 'L' suffix for a long literal)\n",
    "- Default Value: 0L (Note the 'L' suffix for a long literal)\n",
    "- Unsigned Long Support: In Java SE 8 and later, can represent unsigned 64-bit longs from 0 to 264-1. Requires using the Long class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. float\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: A single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.\n",
    "- Range: The precise range is beyond the scope of this discussion, but defined in the Java Language Specification.\n",

    "- Default Value: 0.0f (Note the 'f' suffix for a float literal)\n",
    "- Caution: Should never be used for precise values like currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. double\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: A double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.\n",
    "- Range: The precise range is beyond the scope of this discussion, but defined in the Java Language Specification.\n",
    "- Declaration: `double salary = 50000.50d;` (Note the 'd' suffix for a double literal)\n",
    "- Default Value: 0.0d (Note the 'd' suffix for a double literal)\n",
    "- Common Use: Generally the default choice for floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: Represents a true/false condition.\n",
    "- Range: Only two possible values: true or false.\n",

    "- Declaration: `char initial = 'J';`\n",
    "- Default Value: `'\\u0000'` (or 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- String: String is not a primitive data type; it’s a class. Strings enclosed in double quotes (e.g., \"Hello\") create a String object. String objects are often treated as similar to primitive data types due to their usage in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default Values: It's generally bad practice to rely on default values for data type fields. Always initialize them explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Local Variables: Uninitialized local variables don’t have a default value. Accessing them will result in a compile-time error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Java Literals - Comprehensive Study Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Literals?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A literal is the source code representation of a fixed value that appears directly in your code without requiring computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Literals represent fixed values\n",
    "- They don't require the `new` keyword (unlike objects)\n",
    "- Used primarily with primitive types\n",
    "- Values are known at compile time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Types and Literal Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive types are special data types built into Java (not objects created from classes). Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "boolean result = true;\n",
    "char capitalC = 'C';\n",
    "byte b = 100;\n",
    "short s = 10000;\n",
    "int i = 100000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integer Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Determination\n",
    "- **Default**: `int` type\n",
    "- **Long**: Add `L` or `l` suffix (uppercase `L` recommended for readability)\n",
    "- **Range**: Values exceeding `int` range require long literals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "| System | Base | Digits | Prefix | Example |\n",
    "|--------|------|--------|--------|---------|\n",
    "| Decimal | 10 | 0-9 | None | `26` |\n",
    "| Hexadecimal | 16 | 0-9, A-F | `0x` | `0x1a` |\n",
    "| Binary | 2 | 0-1 | `0b` | `0b11010` |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int decVal = 26;        // Decimal\n",
    "int hexVal = 0x1a;      // Hexadecimal  \n",
    "int binVal = 0b11010;   // Binary (Java SE 7+)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floating-Point Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Determination\n",
    "- **Default**: `double` type\n",
    "- **Float**: Add `F` or `f` suffix\n",
    "- **Double**: Add `D` or `d` suffix (optional, since it's default)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scientific Notation\n",
    "Use `E` or `e` for scientific notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "double d1 = 123.4;      // Standard notation\n",
    "double d2 = 1.234e2;    // Scientific notation (same value)\n",
    "float f1 = 123.4f;      // Float literal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Character and String Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Rules\n",
    "- **char literals**: Use single quotes `'C'`\n",
    "- **String literals**: Use double quotes `\"Hello\"`\n",
    "- Support Unicode (UTF-16) characters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unicode Escapes\n",
    "```java\n",
    "char c = '\\u0108';              // Capital C with circumflex\n",
    "String s = \"S\\u00ED Se\\u00F1or\"; // \"Sí Señor\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Escape Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Escape | Meaning |\n",
    "|--------|---------|\n",
    "| `\\b` | Backspace |\n",
    "| `\\t` | Tab |\n",
    "| `\\n` | Line feed (newline) |\n",
    "| `\\f` | Form feed |\n",
    "| `\\r` | Carriage return |\n",
    "| `\\\"` | Double quote |\n",
    "| `\\'` | Single quote |\n",
    "| `\\\\` | Backslash |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### null Literal\n",
    "- Can be assigned to any reference type variable\n",
    "- **Cannot** be assigned to primitive type variables\n",
    "- Often used as a marker for unavailable objects\n",
    "- Limited functionality beyond presence testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Literal\n",
    "- Format: `TypeName.class`\n",
    "- Example: `String.class`\n",
    "- Returns a `Class` object representing the type itself\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underscore Characters in Numeric Literals (Java SE 7+)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "- Improve code readability\n",
    "- Separate groups of digits\n",
    "- Similar to using commas or spaces as separators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Valid Usage Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "long creditCardNumber = 1234_5678_9012_3456L;\n",
    "long socialSecurityNumber = 999_99_9999L;\n",
    "float pi = 3.14_15F;\n",
    "long hexBytes = 0xFF_EC_DE_5E;\n",
    "long hexWords = 0xCAFE_BABE;\n",
    "long maxLong = 0x7fff_ffff_ffff_ffffL;\n",
    "byte nybbles = 0b0010_0101;\n",
    "long bytes = 0b11010010_01101001_10010100_10010010;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Underscore Placement Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ **VALID Placements**\n",
    "- Between any digits\n",
    "- Multiple consecutive underscores allowed\n",
    "- In any number system (decimal, hex, binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ❌ **INVALID Placements**\n",
    "- At the beginning or end of a number\n",
    "- Adjacent to a decimal point\n",
    "- Before `F`, `f`, `L`, or `l` suffixes\n",
    "- In radix prefixes (`0x`, `0b`)\n",
    "- Where a string of digits is expected\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invalid Examples\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// These will cause compilation errors:\n",
    "float pi1 = 3_.1415F;           // Adjacent to decimal point\n",
    "float pi2 = 3._1415F;           // Adjacent to decimal point\n",
    "long ssn1 = 999_99_9999_L;      // Before L suffix\n",
    "int x2 = 52_;                   // At end of number\n",
    "int x4 = 0_x52;                 // In radix prefix\n",
    "int x5 = 0x_52;                 // At beginning after prefix\n",
    "int x7 = 0x52_;                 // At end of number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Valid Examples\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// These are perfectly fine:\n",
    "int x1 = 5_2;                   // Between digits\n",
    "int x3 = 5_______2;             // Multiple underscores\n",
    "int x6 = 0x5_2;                 // In hexadecimal\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use uppercase `L`** for long literals (avoid confusion with digit `1`)\n",
    "2. **Use underscores** to improve readability of large numbers\n",
    "3. **Be consistent** with underscore placement patterns\n",
    "4. **Choose appropriate suffixes** (`f` for float, `L` for long)\n",
    "5. **Use Unicode escapes** when special characters aren't directly supported\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Java literals provide a direct way to represent fixed values in source code. Understanding the different types, their syntax rules, and best practices is essential for writing clear, maintainable Java code. The addition of underscore support in numeric literals (Java SE 7+) significantly improves code readability for large numbers."
