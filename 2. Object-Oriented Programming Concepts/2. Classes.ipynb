    "In the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. **A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Bicycle class is one possible implementation of a bicycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Bicycle {\n",
    "\n",
    "    int cadence = 0;\n",
    "    int speed = 0;\n",
    "    int gear = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "    void changeCadence(int newValue) {\n",
    "         cadence = newValue;\n",
    "    }\n",

    "The Bicycle class does not contain a main method. That's because it's not a complete application; it's just the blueprint for bicycles that might be used in an application. The responsibility of creating and using new Bicycle objects belongs to some other class in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a BicycleDemo class that creates two separate Bicycle objects and invokes their methods:\n",
